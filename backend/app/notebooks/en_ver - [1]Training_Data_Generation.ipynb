      "3|Shortly after celebrating Rome’s birthday (see here), Hadrian departed on his journey to the northern provinces and began his first extensive voyage through the empire. As he intended to be absent for a considerable time with little idea of the date in return, it was necessary to leave the control of Rome in trustworthy hands. He left Annius Verus, the grandfather of Marcus Aurelius, who was just born (see here), and his friend Turbo to look after the people and the senate.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|After this he travelled  to the provinces of Gaul,  and came to the relief of all the communities with various acts of generosity, and from there he went over into Germany. HA Hadr. 10.1-2\n",
      "\n",
      "2|So it seems that Hadrian headed to Gallia Narbonensis (southern France), then moved through Gallia Lugdunensis and from there went to Germany. He probably sailed from Ostia to Massilia (Marseille), southern Gaul’s main port, and proceeded up the Rhône River valley in the direction of Lugdunum (Lyon)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|His entourage included the Guard Prefect Septicius Clarus and his chief secretary, Tranquillus Suetonius, the historian and author of The Twelve Caesars. Sabina was most likely with him as the Historia Augusta places the incident of Clarus and Suetonius’ excessive familiarity with the empress in Britain, which Hadrian was to visit in 122 after he inspected the German frontier (Hadr\n",
      "\n",
      "2|11.3). Hadrian would abruptly fire both men.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|By the Hadrianic era, Gaul was already a rich and flourishing county with well-established urbanisation and well-developed civic centres. It consisted at this time of four provinces; Narbonensis, which was governed by the senate, and Lugdunensis, Aquitania and Belgica, which were ruled by a proconsul of praetorian rank\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Lugdunum was the capital of these last three provinces. Hadrian may have used this important administrative centre as a base for a few months\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Unfortunately, his precise movements inside Gaul are highly elusive. His journey possibly began at the port of Massilia (Birley, 1997)\n",
      "\n",
      "1|This famous Greek colony of the Phocaeans founded around 600 BC was still a free city, a reward for its invaluable assistance and loyalty to Rome.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Massilia played a major role in distributing Mediterranean goods along the coast of Gaul and Iberia and into inland Gaul on the rivers Durance and Rhône, relying on a series of trading posts. As Carthage’s rival and Rome longstanding ally, the city thrived by acting as a link between Gaul and Rome’s insatiable need for new products and slaves. It retained its Greek character for a considerable length of time despite the gradual process of romanisation. Its Greek legacy lived on in the urban fabric – complete with a theatre, agora and temples – in its constitution and culture.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The Phocaean city also shone by its schools of science and was home to many renowned sailors and explorers. In the 6th century BC, the Massaliote Euthymenes left the city to explore the coast of West Africa beyond the columns of Hercules. In the 4th century BC, Phytheas made a voyage of exploration to north-western Europe, visited a considerable part of modern-day Great Britain and Ireland, and went as far north as Iceland and the Arctic Circle.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|From Massilia, Hadrian probably sailed north up the Rhône River (Rhodanus) in the direction of Lugdunum. Two years earlier, in 119, the river boatmen of this river, the nautae Rhodanici, had made an offering to Hadrian (see here). They erected a statue of the emperor in the town of Tournus (Tournon-sur-Rhône) between Valencia (Valence) and Vienna (Vienne), at the confluence of the Rhône and the Doux, praising his generosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The Rhodanus provided a significant channel for communication and trade between the Mediterranean and central Gaul, and its chief tributary, the Arar (modern Saône), gave access to the Rhineland. The Rhodanus dominated the province of Narbonensis, flowing through Lugdunum (Lyon), Vienna (Vienne), Valentia (Valence), Acunum (Montélimar), Arausio (Orange), Avennio (Avignon), and Arelate (Arles), where the river divides into two large branches. These towns were established on the eastern side of the river’s bank and the via Agrippa.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Some of these cities, and others, may have received new rights from Hadrian, and at least one new Gallic colony was created at Avennio, perhaps even during this tour (Fraser, 2006). An inscription (now lost), found in Apt in 1786 and wrongly suspected for some time as fake (CIL XII 1120), mentions the Colonia Iulia Hadriana Avenniensis, showing that Hadrian elevated Avignon to a Roman colony. It was the highest status that a city could achieve. The medieval town of Avignon has left very few architectural remains from the Roman city, and none of its vestiges seems to have been dated to Hadrian’s time.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|It is rather interesting to note that the funerary inscription from Apt mentions a priest (sacerdos) called Lucius Volusius Severianus (from the Voltinia tribe). They cared for the veneration of the goddess Urbs Roma Aeterna (the personification of the city of Rome)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Her cult had become official by establishing the recent festival Romaia (Natalis Urbis Romae) by Hadrian on the foundation day of the town (21 April 121) and the inauguration of the magnificent temple on the Velian Hill, which he dedicated to Roma Aeterna and Venus Felix. The eternity of the city thereby became an integral part of imperial propaganda and a subject of public worship\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Sacerdotes of this cult were to be found in Italy (outside Rome) and in the provinces in several towns (Ticinum CIL V 6991, Brixia CIL V 4484, Flavia Solva CIL III 5443).\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Although no inscription confirms the presence of Hadrian at Lugdunum, his itinerary along the Rhône Valley can hardly have omitted the capital of the Three Gauls (Tres Galliae). A stay there would have been unavoidable, with some modern scholars even suggesting that he wintered there in 121/122\n",
      "\n",
      "2|However, the German frontier was probably his absolute goal. If that was the case, as argued by Birley (1997), there is no reason to believe that he stayed in Lugdunum over such a long period and that he continued to journey north towards the Rhine only in the spring of 122\n",
      "\n",
      "1|That would have left him very little time to inspect the limes before sailing to Britain in the summer of 122.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Lugdunum was founded as a Roman colony in 43 BC by Lucius Munatius Plancus, nine years after Caesar had completed his conquest of Gaul. Thanks to its prime location at the confluence of the Rhône and Saône, the city became a great commercial centre for Gaul and the nodal point of Agrippa’s Gallic road network, at the centre of four converging roads\n",
      "\n",
      "2|These radiated west to Aquitania, north to the Rhine and the northern coast, south to Arelate, Narbonne and the Mediterranean coast, and east to Lake Léman. Several decades after its foundations, Lugdunum received the favours of Augustus\n",
      "\n",
      "2|He decided to create a great sanctuary dedicated to the Imperial cult and establish an imperial mint that supplied gold and silver coins for half a century. As the capital and religious centre of the Three Gauls, Lugdunum was among the cities where the imperial authority was most present after Rome\n",
      "\n",
      "1|It was the residence of the governor of the province and many high imperial civil servants from the Equestrian order.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Lugdunum was at the height of its prosperity at the time of Hadrian’s visit. It offered all the attractions of a great city and must have provided suitable accommodation for an emperor. The city boasted a forum, a temple of Roma and Augustus, a sanctuary for Cybele, a theatre, an odeon, an amphitheatre and a circus for chariot races.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The majority of Lugdunum’s public buildings were built during the Augustan period. Hadrian is said to have embellished the city and commissioned the restorations of a number of these buildings that required repair\n",
      "\n",
      "2|However, the dating of these restorations is mainly due to tradition rather than scientific research. Even stratigraphic excavations and architectural decoration study have not precisely attributed these constructions or embellishments to Hadrian (Fellague, 2016)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|For sure, Hadrian had a team of architects, surveyors and builders, and the Historia Augusta refers to imperial favours given during a trip. Still, the dating to Hadrian’s reign remains hypothetical.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Tradition has it that Hadrian renovated and embellished the forum, repaired and decorated the theatre. The latter building, which originally had a seating capacity of 5000 spectators, was extended to seat 10,000\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The cavea was made bigger with the addition of a third row. The stage building was embellished with columns and statues, and the orchestra floor was renovated with grey granite paving bordered with pink and green marble\n",
      "\n",
      "2|A cuirassed statue of Hadrian (of which only fragments remain) was placed in the scaenae frons. An Odeon was built to the south of the theatre at the end of the 1st or early 2nd century AD\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Its construction is sometimes attributed to Hadrian. Used for music and recitations, the Odeon was partly roofed and could hold around 3000 people seated in two rows of seats.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The amphitheatre was enlarged and restored later in Hadrian’s reign, c. 130/136, to increase its capacity to 20,000 spectators\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Thanks to a building inscription, we know that the original amphitheatre was built during the reign of Tiberius in AD 19 by Gaius Julius Rufus, a priest of Rome and Augustus and a native of Mediolanum Santonum (modern-day Saintes in western France). It was relatively small in size with a single tier of seating and a capacity of only 1,800 and was located at the sacred precinct at Condate (the Confluence) above the rivers on a hillside\n",
      "\n",
      "1|During the reign of Hadrian, two tiers of seats were added around the old amphitheatre, bringing its dimensions to 143 x 117 m, comparable to the arenas of Nîmes and Arles.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Near the amphitheatre (probably) stood the imperial Sanctuary of the Three Gauls. Inaugurated in 12 BC by Drusus, this religious complex dedicated to “Rome and Augustus” was the earliest and most important institution of its kind in the western part of the empire. It was here that every year in August, delegates from sixty cities from the three Gallic provinces met together to celebrate religious ceremonies and re-affirm their allegiance to the emperor (Concilium Galliarum). The connection between the sanctuary with the amphitheatre is clear from the seat inscriptions marking places for cult officials and council representatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The central element of the sanctuary was an altar that can be reconstructed from ancient written sources and representations on coins. The structure is shown to be rectangular, decorated in front with crowns and laurel branches in bas-reliefs and topped with tripods. It is flanked by two columns supporting statues of winged Victories, each holding a palm branch and garland.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The altar appears to have been rebuilt (or adapted) as a covered temple by Hadrian, while the original columns supporting the statues of the Victories were replace by columns of Egyptian Syenite (Fishwick, 1972). There is indeed an inscription (CIL XIII 1685) that mentions a donation from Hadrian to the altar of the Three Gauls, but the gaps in the text do not allow us to specify the nature of this favour (Fellague, 2016). Unfortunately, no trace of the monument itself has been found.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Another public building presumably built in the beginning of the 2nd century AD was the circus, the existence of which is confirmed by the magnificent mosaic of a chariot race discovered in 1806 in the Ainay district of Lyon, but also by a number of inscriptions. Its location is still debated, but it most probably stood on the heights of Fourvière behind the great theatre. The edifice would have measured 370 metres long and around 100 metres wide.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The urban development of Lugdunum was intimately connected with the growth of its water supply. Four large aqueducts provided water to the city with a total length of 200 kilometres supplying 39,000 cubic metres per day\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This was the second-largest network of Roman aqueducts after Rome itself. During the first decades of its foundation, two aqueducts were built that fed the hill town of Fourvière and Mont-d’Or\n",
      "\n",
      "2|A third, built under Claudius, brought water into the low-lying quarter of Les Minimes. A fourth, the Gier Aqueduct, was the longest (86 km) of the four and the most monumental\n",
      "\n",
      "2|To protect the water channel, the aqueduct was underground for 95% of its course, and the difference in altitude between the two ends was only 150 metres. Its piers and arcades have been preserved in many places, as have several large reservoirs linked by siphons: the most impressive remains are at Chaponost and Beaunant.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Roman aqueducts required a comprehensive system of maintenance, cleaning and repair. They were access points at regular interval (77 metres or 240 Roman feet) where the vault of the channel was cut through by a sort of chimney with small cavities inside to help with the climbing down\n",
      "\n",
      "2|About 100 of these access-points have been identified along the Gier aqueduct but there were originally around 1,000. The aqueduct was protected by a series of marker stones that served to delimit the areas where farming and other activities were not permitted\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Two Hadrianic stone inscriptions (CIL XIII, 1623) found on the Gier Aqueduct southwest of Lyon refer to a ban on cultivating land near the aqueduct. Hadrian prohibited ploughing, sowing and planting in the grounds reserved for the aqueduct’s protection to preserve the channel from any damage and avoid the water being polluted\n",
      "\n",
      "1|These marker stones must have been posted at regular intervals along the aqueduct’s course as both inscriptions were found 6 kilometres apart.\n",
      "\n",

      "4|The facts of this recent event, which went largely unnoticed by a distracted world, are quickly laid out: In early July of this year, Turkey’s Council of State debated annulment of the 1934 decision to convert Hagia Sophia to a museum. The outcome of this debate was a forgone conclusion, as the Council was packed with loyalists to President Erdogan, the Islamist head of state, who had also served as Prime Minister from 2004-2014. On July 14, the Council voted to proceed and it was announced that the first Islamic prayers would be held inside the building on July 24. The screen capture below, from the Turkish government’s website, shows how quickly this decision was implemented.\n",

      "4|Hagia Sophia’s status as a museum since 1935 had been a powerful symbol of Turkey’s secular status. This was a uniquely Turkish national characteristic among Middle Eastern nations. But under a resurgent Islamist political party, the AKP, with Erdogan at its head, Turkey’s secular institutions have been slowly dismantled and power centralized under an increasingly authoritarian, anti-free press regime. The conversion announcement was condemned by UNESCO, various heads of state around the world, the Pope, heads of all the Orthodox churches and by the secular Turkish novelist and Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk.\n",

These included new enemies, migratory people such as the Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Huns and many others who had been slowly moving westward from their original homelands in the Central Asian Steppe regions\n",

      "2|In recent decades there has been a resurgence of interest in the Byzantine world, and a much deeper appreciation of Byzantium as a dynamic, multi-cultural society.

But on the whole, I believe his assessment was accurate. For this reason alone, Byzantium, it’s last Emperor Constantine XI, who died fighting at the breach in Constantinople’s walls on its last day, Tuesday, the 29th of May, 1453, and the incomparable achievement of Hagia Sophia itself, deserve better than the disgraceful treatment outlined above.\n",

Historians wanted to keep the activity low-key because it did not support their idealised view of the Greeks and Romans. Today, however, magic is a legitimate area of scholarly enquiry, providing insights into ancient belief systems as well as cultural and social practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|While magic was discouraged and sometimes even punished in antiquity, it thrived all the same. Authorities publicly condemned it, but tended to ignore its powerful hold.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Erotic spells were a popular form of magic. Professional magic practitioners charged fees for writing erotic charms, making enchanted dolls (sometimes called poppets), and even directing curses against rivals in love.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Magic is widely attested in archaeological evidence, spell books and literature from both Greece and Rome, as well as Egypt and the Middle East. The Greek Magical Papyri, for example, from Graeco-Roman Egypt, is a large collection of papyri listing spells for many purposes. The collection was compiled from sources dating from the second century BC to the fifth century AD, and includes numerous spells of attraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Some spells involve making dolls, which were intended to represent the object of desire (usually a woman who was either unaware or resistant to a would-be admirer). Instructions specified how an erotic doll should be made, what words should be said over it, and where it should be deposited.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Such an object is a form of sympathetic magic; a type of enchantment that operates along the principle of “like affects like”. When enacting sympathetic magic with a doll, the spell-caster believes that whatever action is performed on it – be it physical or psychic – will be transferred to the human it represents.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The best preserved and most notorious magical doll from antiquity, the so-called “Louvre Doll” (4th century AD), depicts a naked female in kneeling position, bound, and pierced with 13 needles. Fashioned from unbaked clay, the doll was found in a terracotta vase in Egypt. The accompanying spell, inscribed on a lead tablet, records the woman’s name as Ptolemais and the man who made the spell, or commissioned a magician to do so, as Sarapammon.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|The spells that accompanied such dolls and, indeed, the spells from antiquity on all manner of topics, were not mild in the language and imagery employed. Ancient spells were often violent, brutal and without any sense of caution or remorse. In the spell that comes with the Louvre Doll, the language is both frightening and repellent in a modern context. For example, one part of the spell directed at Ptolemais reads:\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Such language is hardly indicative of any emotion pertaining to love, or even attraction. Especially when combined with the doll, the spell may strike a modern reader as obsessive (perhaps reminiscent of a stalker or online troll) and even misogynistic. Indeed, rather than seeking love, the intention behind the spell suggests seeking control and domination. Such were the gender and sexual dynamics of antiquity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|But in a masculine world, in which competition in all aspects of life was intense, and the goal of victory was paramount, violent language was typical in spells pertaining to anything from success in a court case to the rigging of a chariot race. Indeed, one theory suggests that the more ferocious the words, the more powerful and effective the spell.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Most ancient evidence attests to men as both professional magical practitioners and their clients. There was a need to be literate to perform most magic (most women were not educated) and to be accessible to clients (most women were not free to receive visitors or have a business). However, some women also engaged in erotic magic (although the sources on this are relatively scarce).\n",
      "\n",
      "3|In ancient Athens, for example, a woman was taken to court on the charge of attempting to poison her husband. The trial was recorded in a speech delivered on behalf of the prosecution (dated around 419 BC). It includes the woman’s defence, which stated that she did not intend to poison her husband but to administer a love philtre to reinvigorate the marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Within the multiplicity of spells found in the Greek Magical Papyri, two deal specifically with female same sex desire. In one of these, a woman by the name of Herais attempts to magically entreat a woman by the name of Serapis. In this spell, dated to the second century AD, the gods Anubis and Hermes are called upon to bring Serapis to Herais and to bind Serapis to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In the second spell, dated to the third or fourth century AD, a woman called Sophia seeks out a woman by the name of Gorgonia. This spell, written on a lead tablet, is aggressive in tone; for example:\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Gods and goddesses were regularly summoned in magic. In the spell to attract Serapis, for example, Anubis is included based on his role as the god of the secrets of Egyptian magic. Hermes, a Greek god, was often included because as a messenger god, he was a useful choice in spells that sought contact with someone.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Deities with erotic connections were also inscribed on gems to induce attraction. The Greek god of eroticism, Eros was a popular figure to depict on a gemstone, which could then be fashioned into a piece of jewellery.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The rigid system of clearly demarcated gender roles of active (male) and passive (female) partners, based on a patriarchy that championed dominance and success at all costs, underpinned the same societies’ magical practices. Yet it is important to note that even in magic featuring people of the same sex, aggressive language is employed because of the conventions that underlined ancient spells.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Still magic remains, in part, a mystery when it comes to erotic practice and conventions. The two same-sex spells from the Greek Magical Papyri, for example, attest to the reality of erotic desire among ancient women, but do not shed light on whether this type of sexuality was condoned in Roman Egypt. Perhaps such desires were not socially approved; hence the recourse to magic. Perhaps the desires of Sarapammon for Ptolemais were also outside the bounds of acceptability, which led him to the surreptitious and desperate world of magic.\n",

A specialist papyrus restorer was brought to Basel to separate the sheets, enabling the Greek document to be decoded for the first time.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|“This is a sensational discovery,” says Sabine Huebner, Professor of Ancient History at the University of Basel. “The majority of papyri are documents such as letters, contracts and receipts. This is a literary text, however, and they are vastly more valuable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3|What’s more, it contains a previously unknown text from antiquity. “We can now say that it’s a medical text from late antiquity that describes the phenomenon of ‘hysterical apnea’,” says Huebner. “We therefore assume that it is either a text from the Roman physician Galen, or an unknown commentary on his work.” After Hippocrates, Galen is regarded as the most important physician of antiquity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The decisive evidence came from Italy – an expert saw parallels to the famous Ravenna papyri from the chancery of the Archdiocese of Ravenna. These include many antique manuscripts from Galen, which were later used as palimpsests and written over\n",

      "2|The Basel papyrus could be a similar case of medieval recycling, as it consists of multiple sheets glued together and was probably used as a book binding. The other Basel Amerbach papyrus in Latin script is also thought to have come from the Archdiocese of Ravenna\n",

For three years, she has been working with an interdisciplinary team in collaboration with the University of Basel’s Digital Humanities Lab to examine the papyrus collection, which in the meantime has been digitalized, transcribed, annotated and translated. The project team has already presented the history of the papyrus collection through an exhibition in the University Library last year. They plan to publish all their findings at the start of 2019.\n",

Quarrying and moving a 263-ton chunk of granite – with the additional issue of not having access to any metal harder than bronze – is no mean feat.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|The process used by the Egyptians was surprisingly straightforward. Initially, they levelled off the ground above a vein of granite. Then the rough shape of the obelisk was marked using hard stone pounders. Channels were carved in the rock around the shape of the obelisk before it was separated from the bedrock entirely by carving under its bulk.\n",

      "\n",
      "2|While these imitations of Egyptian styles and fashions (creatively altered for a Roman audience) were extremely popular, several Roman rulers went a step further. Rather than simply imitating Egyptian architecture, they brought some home with them from Egypt.\n",

      "2|After the defeat of Cleopatra and Mark Anthony in 30 BCE, the first Roman emperor, Augustus Caesar, set his sights on the Flaminian Obelisk which had remained for more than 1,200 years at Heliopolis. To commemorate his comprehensive victory, Augustus opted to bring the obelisk back to Rome on a specially designed vessel, which was later destroyed in a fire in Puteoli.\n",

      "2|Upon its arrival in Rome, Augustus added a Latin inscription underneath the far older hieroglyphs of the obelisk, extolling his own triumphs as the new ruler of Egypt. To show off his achievement, he ordered the obelisk raised at Circus Maximus.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|As Christianity rose to prominence and became the official state religion of the Roman Empire, the arena fell into decay and flooding eventually toppled the obelisk. It was gradually buried in alluvial soil, lying undiscovered for nearly 1,000 years until it was unearthed at the height of the Italian Renaissance in 1587.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|A product of the Italian Renaissance, Pope Sixtus V (1521-1590) embarked on a wide-ranging programme of urban renewal in Rome shortly after his election to the Papal Throne. Ironically, while he is credited with reerecting no less than four ancient obelisks in Rome, he had very little appreciation for the city’s own antiquity, ordering several ancient monuments demolished and the stone reused as building material.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|When the Flaminian Obelisk was rediscovered in 1587, Sixtus charged the noted architect Domenico Fontana (1543-1607) with the task of raising the monolith in Piazza del Popolo (at that time a place of public executions), a task which he accomplished in 1589. Fontana was experienced in the art of raising obelisks – three years earlier, he had been responsible for placing the Vatican obelisk (which is heavier than the Flaminian obelisk by nearly 100 tons) in St Peter’s Square. In an attempt to detract from the quite obvious pagan nature of the monuments, both were crowned with large crosses.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|With this, the journey of the Flaminian Obelisk from an ancient Egyptian tribute to the sun god to a Renaissance curio was completed. But the monument’s impact on history continued – in 1921, a year before seizing power after the March on Rome, Benito Mussolini (1883-1945) led a march past the obelisk during the Third Fascist Congress. Later on, the Flaminian Obelisk and the many other Egyptian and Roman obelisks found throughout the city prompted the dictator to create his own: a massive 300-ton marble behemoth which still stands in Foro Italico (then Foro Mussolini) bearing the Latin inscription MVSSOLINI DVX(Mussolini, the Leader).\n",

A higher ECI is a representation of a more complex economy\n",

Using United Nations (UN) export data, the ECI sorts the diversity and ubiquity of all countries’ exports for a given year and generates a ranking using both measures to correct for each other mathematically. Note that diversity captures how many exports a country is competitive in and ubiquity captures what type of exports. The ECI combines ubiquity and diversity and attempts to infer about countries productive capabilities or complexity by making relative comparisons across export baskets (Mealy, Farmer, & Teytelboym, 2017).\n",

Theoretically, the ECI formulas could be modified to use data on the composition of both goods and services, but the lack of a comprehensive data set and uniform categorization of services make this difficult if not impossible. Despite these issues, the ECI remains relevant when considering developing countries where exports are a substantial part of the domestic economy.

The ECI is the primary independent variable of interest, and it has substantial benefits over using only values such as per capita GDP that does not capture changes in the underlying productive structures of an economy. The ECI is also an important benchmark for the relative success of economic development strategies that rely on Export-Oriented Industrialization (EOI) since the index measures the diversity and ubiquity of goods that an economy produces.\n",

      "1|Unlike other East Asian nations, Indonesia did not lack natural resources and could have feasibly relied on oil revenues and not diversified its economy; however, it chose to pursue export-led industrialization which has been responsible for faster growth and lower levels of income inequality.\n",

      "3|After WWII, Indonesia, like many nations in Southeast Asia, found itself in a vulnerable position as an economically and militarily weak state that was plagued by religious and ethnic conflicts. Indonesian leaders transformed those fears of war and instability into a remarkable developmental energy that eventually became a binding agent for growth. The pursuit of wealth in the context of stability, security, and catching up with the rest of the world were vastly more effective in generating developmental energy than a general appeal to increase welfare, which is a common thread among Latin American “populism.”(Woo-Cumings, 1999).\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The absence in Latin America of the kind of vulnerability and urgency one finds in East Asia has to do with Latin American nations attaining political independence and beginning industrialization a century earlier.

      "\n",
      "2|Additionally, the wealth of natural resources available to Latin American nations, combined with their relatively small populations, provided an easy alternative to the difficult task of industrialization.

Due to lack of reliable income distribution data for Venezuela from 2007 onward, the data set and all regression analysis between the ECI and Gini coefficient occurs from 1965-2006.

      "\n",
      "2|More simply, the Gini index is a number that lies between 0 (perfect equality—everyone has the same) and 100 (perfect inequality, with one person having everything).

      "\n",
      "2|These polices helped to aid export competitiveness by reducing the cost of exports and encouraging foreign investment. Suharto’s industrialization push came after the collapse of global oil prices in early 1980 and has reduced dependence on oil exports (Schwarz, 1999)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The rise in economic complexity continued until the Asian Financial Crisis in mid-1997 when the Indonesian economy collapsed. It was particularly vulnerable due to a lack of formal state controls, specifically a pilot agency, such as the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) in Japan, which would have prioritized macroeconomic stability and mitigated the severe economic distortions that eventually eroded investor confidence in the Indonesian economy and led to substantial capital flight (Müller, 2014; Woo-Cumings, 1999)\n",

      "3|From the above results, we can see the most significant reduction in income inequality comes from an increase in GDP per capita, with the Economic Complexity Index coming in at a close second. This is consistent with previous research that has found a robust correlation between ECI and GDP per capita. An important consideration is that ECI is also shown to predict future economic growth, so improvements in productive structures have yielded both reductions in income inequality and greater levels of economic growth (Hartmann et al., 2017).\n",

The Polity IV rose from -7 (autocracy) in 1997 to 6 (democracy) in 2004 after the presidential election.

      "2|During the 1980s, the surplus of crude oil caused by a combination of reduced demand and increased production led to substantial decline in the price of oil.

      "2|The decline in government redistribution outstripped improvements in Venezuela’s productive structures that came from the government’s attempts to stabilize, liberalize and diversify the economy.

      "\n",
      "1|The ability of these technocrats to influence economic policy differed considerably from Venezuela where rapid changes in economic conditions (associated with large fluctuations in the price of oil) led to political crises and the election of new leaders that seldom maintained any consistency in policy.\n",

      "2|While authoritarianism can overcome political constraints and mobilize the population to sacrifice current prosperity for the sake of developmental projects, this was never completely the case in Indonesia (Müller, 2014; Woo-Cumings, 1999). Rather than cultivate a relationship between the state and business through industrial policy, as in South Korea, it was done through ethnic division of labor with development, not for the sake of shared prosperity, but rather for the sake of payoffs\n",

      "2|Suharto and his family were the owners of many conglomerates that benefited from export-led growth, and the minority ethnic Chinese that represented the business class or entrepreneurial element of the economy were under constant threat of persecution.

      "2|Despite governmental efforts supporting industrialization in the 1960s and ‘70s with import substitution policies, said policies never truly came to fruition. The failure of industrial policy can be partially linked to “Dutch disease”, where an increase in natural resource revenues undermines export-based manufacturing because substantial commodity exports cause exchange rate appreciation (Fardmanesh, 1991)\n",
      "\n",
      "1|This “disease” has pulled capital and labor from non-resource related sectors and made Venezuela further reliant on oil revenue.\n",

      "\n",
      "2|Hugo Chavez, the former president of Venezuela, was a democratic populist who came to power in 1999 after two decades economic stagnation. Under Chavez’s rule, Venezuelans prospered through generous social welfare programs and redistributive policies funded through oil revenues (McCaughan, 2011)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|However, he became increasingly frustrated with courts blocking his legislation and media outlets criticizing his programs. Soon after, Chavez began to actively undermine the courts by removing judges, and he sought to silence journalists with anti-defamation laws\n",

      "2|These discrete legal changes undermined Venezuelan democracy and centralized power with the executive branch of the government.

HPEA primarily went through the process of industrialization in the latter half of the twentieth century with consistent policies; however, Latin American countries, including Venezuela, have had waves of extreme industrialization through import-substitution followed by equally extreme efforts to liberalize and reform (Hartmann et al., 2016). Neither state intervention nor liberalization have successfully diversified LAC economies, which remain heavily dependent on natural resource extraction (Hartmann et al., 2016).\n",

      "3|Figure 6 illustrates the vast differences in the productive capabilities in between LAC and China. China’s exports primarily consist of complex machinery and other finished goods that require sophisticated factories and indicate a high degree of economic complexity. Latin American countries’ (LAC) exports consist largely of natural resources like crude oil, metals, and non-processed agricultural goods.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|While HPEA, like China, have diversified, LAC remain reliant on the exportation of commodities. These structural differences have serious implications for income inequality in both regions because the productive structures of an economy also act as structural constraints on income inequality. A country with high levels of economic complexity will usually not exhibit high levels of income inequality because the structure of the economy is more inclusive and is also not reliant on governmental redistributive policies to achieve lower income inequality (Hartmann et al., 2016).\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Many Latin American countries have had generous welfare policies that are intended to reduce income inequality, but these policies tend to be constrained since government revenues are usually reliant on no more than a few sectors of the economy (Hardesty, 2017). Venezuela is a commonly cited example because the Chavez and Maduro administrations focused the economy on oil production and attempted to use the revenues to fund programs and provide direct cash subsidies\n",
      "\n",
      "2|However, despite these policies, income inequality has been rising since Chavez took office in 1998. Reliance on the concentrated economic power of the national oil industry led to rent-seeking behavior, mismanagement, and a grossly-unequal distribution of resources (McCaughan, 2011)\n",
      "\n",
      "1|The Venezuelan government maintained a monopoly on oil production by distributing the benefits and, therefore, feeding a relationship of dependency among citizens and private interests who, over time, became accustomed to thinking of oil wealth as something the government guarantees and thus its absence was deeply destructive.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Low levels of economic complexity are accompanied by high levels of income inequality because the structure of the economy is less inclusive and economic power more concentrated. Thus, redistributive policies to achieve lower income inequality have hard limits and must be accompanied by efforts to diversify the economy (Hartmann et al., 2016)\n",

      "2|There exist inextricable links between political and economic development that are shown to have a substantial impact on the level of income inequality both within individual nations and across regions. This case study of Indonesia and Venezuela illustrates how both nations have diverged and are proxies for broader economic and political trends across Latin America and East Asia\n",

As the subscript t labels the variables by year between 2007-2018, the model is optimal because it was able to compare the output of firms exposed to dual-use goods list as the Israeli Government changed the number of items on the list between 2007 and 2015\n",

      "2|The regression demonstrates manufacturing output in the Gaza Strip increases $41.24 when the amount of electricity a manufacturing activity bought increases $1. Because firms pay the VAT when importing products, the correlation between the total VAT a firm pays and output shows Gazan manufacturing firms with higher output rely on imported products (Table 2)\n",

      "2|The correlation between a manufacturing firm’s purchase of imports and output was statistically significant during the years of the near total Israeli blockade on imports while not significant between 2010 and 2018.

      "\n",
      "2|At both Israeli-West Bank and Jordanian-West Bank crossings, Palestinian importers unload products from Israeli or Jordanian trucks for Israeli security personnel to manually inspect and repackage into Palestinian trucks (Palestine Trade Center, n.d.). The manual security checks cause potential damage to goods, longer wait times, higher transportation costs, and spoilage of temperature sensitive goods as the checkpoints only provide unrefrigerated storage areas (The World Bank, n.d.)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Lastly, Israeli personnel rather than PNA personnel perform security and operations on the Palestinian side of Israeli-West Bank and Jordanian-West Bank commercial checkpoints (The World Bank Group, 2017). Because of the security measures common at all West Bank crossings, Palestinian importers face some security related cost no matter the port a product enters from\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Hence, an Israeli streamlining of the security inspection process would reduce costs and wait times at all crossings into the West Bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Despite costs due to security restrictions at Israeli ports, overall, Israeli ports are more attractive to shipping companies importing products to the West Bank. The Israeli ports are closer to Palestinian cities like Hebron, Ramallah, and Nablus\n",

      "2|The Ports of Ashdod and Haifa are far cheaper than the port of Aqaba when the ship sails from African, American, or European ports. Additionally, the transportation costs to Palestinian cities is lower when the business imports from Israeli Ports vs Aqaba (see Table 7 and 8)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|When Palestinians import through Israeli ports Palestinian merchants do not have to worry about transferring products from containers to pallets as the Israeli-West Bank crossings are able to handle containers where the KHB cannot (Palestine Trade Center, 2013, p. 108)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The higher security costs for containerized products through the Port of Aqaba with higher shipping costs for products going to the Jordanian port mean Palestinians overwhelmingly rely on Israeli ports to import products. Therefore, Palestinian importers are more likely to pay the security-related costs at Israeli ports.\n",

      "2|As Israel collects Palestinian VAT and import taxes while maintaining a security presence around the Palestinian territories, the Palestinian economy is dependent upon Israel for funding and trade access. As Dependency theory outlines how unequal relationships between developed and developing states prevent economic growth in developing countries, the theory is useful to explain Israeli-Palestinian economic relations\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Elkhafif et al. (2014) notes despite the 1994 Paris Protocol’s creation of an Israeli-Palestinian customs union, Palestinians cannot carry out customs operations as the Palestinian Authority (PNA) lacks a presence at border-crossing checkpoints and rely on Israel to collect VAT, customs, and import taxes\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The customs union promotes Palestinian reliance on Israeli products while making foreign non-Israeli products more expensive as the PNA cannot lower the VAT more than 2% below the Israeli VAT (Elkhafif et al., 2014, pp. 9-10)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The present study found Palestinian manufacturers when importing goods face Israeli security related costs whether the Port of entry is Israeli or Jordanian. As Israel’s control of Palestinian VAT and import tax collection allows Israel to control a major Palestinian revenue source, the PNA is dependent upon Israel to fulfill the PNA’s budget\n",

      "1|Israeli security measures increasing costs for Palestinian importers shows the unequal customs relationship between Israel and the Palestinian territories negatively impacts Palestinian economic growth as dependency theory states.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Israeli security related costs and exportation of low technology products to the Palestinian territories reduces Palestinian manufacturing competitiveness and benefits Israeli firms as dependency theory states. Israel’s use of its control of access to the West Bank to benefit Israeli firms while raising costs for Palestinian firms aligns with dependency theory’s explanation of how developed states may boost economic growth at the expense of developing states\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Security-related costs do not hinder Israeli made imports because Israeli firms pay less in shipping costs and are not subject to the same security restrictions at Israeli Ports as other imports to the Palestinian territories (Bank of Israel, n.d.). Consequently, Israeli exports to the West Bank did not change when Israel implemented security restrictions due to the Second Intifada as imports from Israel were 70% of total imports before the Second Intifada in 1999 and 72% in 2006\n",

      "2|Offshore natural gas could provide fuel for the Gazan power plant as a European funded pipeline able to transfer 35 billion cubic feet of natural gas a year to the Gaza Strip is under construction; but until the pipeline is completed the Gaza Strip will need international donors to fund Gazan purchases of electricity and fuel (The Times of Israel, 2020). Expanded Gaza Strip electricity access and a subsequent reduction in the amount of power outages would allow Gaza Strip manufacturers to use electricity intensive modes of production and increase productivity\n",

      "\n",
      "1|I conclude by considering the philosophical implications of DMV on a developing postcolonial economics as well as further commentary on some of the central aspects of DMV.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In the history of economic thought, there have been two prominent theories of value: the Labor Theory of Value and the Utilitarian Theory of Value. The Labor Theory of Value postulates that economic value arises from the labor necessarily required to produce the object\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The discipline of economics reorganized itself following Marxist criticism and the Labor Theory of Value gave way to the Utilitarian Theory in mainstream discourse. The Utilitarian Theory of Value is premised on rational choice theory and a flattening of the individual\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Value is measured in how much satisfaction an action, good, etc. can give to a rational consumer; this is what is taught in most economics curriculums and is central to neoclassical modeling\n",
      "\n",
      "2|All individuals are said to have ‘Utility functions’ that measure the relativity of value across sets of market goods. Furthermore, the demand and supply curve in market models are constructed with the idea in mind that individuals acquire goods when considering the marginal gains of utility\n",
      "\n",
      "1|This theory of value fundamentally holds all humans as operating on the same logic of utility maximization; this type of transcendental claim, as we shall see, falls into a culturally specific and historically contingent way of carving up the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|With the advent of the Enlightenment and triumph of scientific rationality, one central tendency of modernity has been the universalization and totalization of humans across cultures on Western ontological grounding and classificatory systems. In particular, it is the Cartesian individual and its placement outside the ties of culture and history that finds itself as the central locus of Utilitarian Value Theory and subsequently Economics as a scientific discipline. Nitasha Kaul is instructional here; she writes,\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The economic ‘subject’ of this unlocated analysis is a self-transparent unembodied and unembedded amoral utility maximizer propped up by Cartesian dualisms and interested narratives of Enlightenment reason. The ‘method’ of accessing valid disciplinary (and disciplined) economic narrative of the subject is mathematical formalism, heroic role of assumptions in a theory deductive nomological explanation, operation of an extremum principle and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The aim of economics (and its theory of value) is formulating the Cartesian individual in a purely scientific light that seeks to establish its claims as universally true and verifiable by positive analysis and intuitive normalization. The area of contestation for Kaul and I is the central focal point of rationality as a universalizing scientific principle for economic analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The invariance of rational preferences in the Utilitarian theory of value makes possible the mathematical formalization essential for the construction of utility functions (and other neoclassical economic modeling tools). Economics asks us to analyze economic activity without asking us who it is we are analyzing, where the subject of analysis is historically and culturally situated, and other factors that do not lend itself to neat formalized models\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Again, Kaul poignantly points to the issues that economic theory suppresses:\n",
      "\n",
      "3|This…formalization as the core of economic theory leaves unchallenged the underlying issues of universalism and modernist stereotypy that form the operational basis of mainstream economic methods. And it is not only formalism which requires that identity be a matter of universal essences. The particularities of inalienably situated historical contexts within which the ‘economic’ is experienced are simplified into general and universal denominations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|We are forced to ask how a purely positivistic and intuitive science can develop out of an analysis of the individual, yet in the same stroke ignore the various aspects of the human condition that are essential renderings of understanding particular individuals? The answer to this question is that it cannot and that the ontological grounding that neoclassical economics and subsequently the Utilitarian Theory of Value cannot be used in an economic inquiry concerned with empirical reality and the social complexes that form it. If the Utilitarian Theory of Value fails to obtain when considered in tandem with the socio-cultural nexuses that operate on the individual, we are left to develop an alternative theory of value; one that does not universalize, but instead focuses on the contextual elements that hold influence over people. I begin to develop one such contextualized theory of valuation in the following sections of this paper, however, let this not be a flattening and pegging of value to abstract numerical continuum as represented in economics literature. I intend this theory of value (or valuation properly) to exist and interact with various others that escape its domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The notion of DMV that I seek to develop in this paper hold a great debt to Nitasha Kaul’s discussion concerning conceptions of value/values. Furthermore, it draws significant influence from the disciplinary effects of developmental ideology that springs out of macroeconomic thought\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Finally, it articulates its link to mimesis via Homi Bhabha. Kaul starts developing this connection first by examining Samuel Bailey’s critique on the Labor Theory of Value in classical political economy\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In Baily, Kaul finds the core of Bailey’s argument focused specifically against the fixing of value as something nvariable. Kaul cites Baily critiquing James Mill’s notion that wine which sets in a basement for a year gains value through labor\n",
      "\n",
      "2|For Bailey, Kaul notes that, “the only accumulation having occurred in this case was an arithmetical, not an actual one.” She further finds in Baily a reaffirmation of the milieu of factors that exerts itself on the mind when considering the value of a given object. In recognizing the variety of influences that operate on the mind in the question of value, she sees a connection to what she terms as valu-ation\n",
      "\n",
      "1|She writes:\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In my reading, this sense of value is amenable to admitting the processual considerations of valu-ation, and need not necessarily be something that applies only to commodities. Value can be aligned to values – worthy of espousing – and, since the subjective dimension of value and values is acknowledged, it allows for admitting the politicized nature of the contest for values.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This, more or less, gives the theoretical base that gives rise to DMV; it fundamentally recognizes that the notion of value extends far beyond pegging it to an invariance principle, but instead recognizes that other “non-economic” forces play a role in the process. Furthermore, it explicitly recognizes the contested nature of values which is a necessary precondition for any disciplining and mimesis to occur\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Thus, the notion of valuation in DMV is lifted directly from Kaul’s work and the concept of valuation necessarily invites inter-disciplinary commentary given the incommensurability of value not located on an abstract invariance principle. Instead of value arising out of an invariance (labor or utility) it instead is subject to a wide variety of considerations that may not explicitly be “economic” in nature\n",
      "\n",
      "2|For example, when I consider the value of a pen, its value does not merely arise out of satisfaction it gives me, but rather there’s a whole variety of psycho-cultural factors playing in my mind when I come to that decision. The pen might have been given to me by someone close and because the community I was socialized in values friendships a certain way, I may extract from it an additional type of value like sentimental value\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In this way, valuation precedes any claim to the utility of a good and, instead, value becomes realized through a complex interrelation of social, individual, and cultural pressures. These pressures ultimately push us to explore disciplinarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Next, the idea of economic development presents in itself a teleological narrative sourced in an imaginative rendering of universal progress. The developmental ideology itself can be said to stem directly from the civilizing mission posited by colonial actors\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The civilizing mission is premised on a singular distinction: that the European societies are superior to non-European societies. Such a distinction was carried out through a variety of methods either through race, religion, cultural prejudice, etc\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Hence, the civilizing mission can be characterized as the European compulsion to “uplift” the “wild and barbarian peoples.” Its teleological ends derive explicitly from resolving the contradictions of the universalist principles of the liberal Enlightenment and the racial and ethnic markers (or any other essentialist rendering of difference) of colonial difference that justified brutal repression. Thus, colonial policy often admitted inconsistency and contradiction\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In the so-called decolonized world, the functional goal of assimilative pressures is supported by the imposition of development as the fundamental ends of the decolonized society. Development in economics can be analyzed through numerical metrics and indexes like those concerning gross domestic product, unemployment, productivity, stability, etc\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Now, it’s not merely the improvement of these metrics that specifically disciplines, but rather their relation to the prescriptive measures taken to raise such levels. Much like Baptism and Christianity were seen as prescriptions to civilize and assimilate colonized peoples, the dominance of the Washington Consensus, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank and the liberalization they propose can be seen as providing the essential prescriptions of development even if such policies prove counter-intuitive to national interest\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Eiman O. Zein Elabdin and S\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Charusheela frame the centralization of development in Economics:\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This basis of development on the European model finds its support in the active constraint of alternative developmental methods by institutions and the operational logic of international institutions. For example, a significant portion of Francophone Africa finds itself tethered to the paternalistic monetary union that ties national currency to the French Franc\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The need to defend the convertibility peg actively constrains macroeconomic stimulus policy; it sets a hard limit (approximately these countries must keep 65% of currency reserves in the French Central Bank) on fiscal and monetary policy in the African countries. To overspend under the regime of the currency peg is to devalue one’s currency and subsequently contribute to vast inflationary pressure\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Even more evidence to this are the numerous conditional lending programs sponsored by the IMF and the World Bank which provide aid under the condition that a set of prescriptive policies perform. Hence, I derive the disciplinary aspect of DMV; it sits in the uncomfortable intersections of disciplinary power and bio-power best resembling the norm that operates, much like the economic theories of value, on a point of invariance for it, “introduces, as a useful imperative and as a result of measurement, all shading of individual differences.” It is disciplinary in the sense that it seeks to meld individuals to a certain cultural point of being and touched with bio-power as this is a strategy not employed at any single individual, but entire cultural groups via civilizing ‘x’ group or developing ‘y’ country.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Lastly, the mimetic derives from Bhabha’s reflection on mimicry and in many ways this theory can be seen as drawing out some of the necessary elements of mimesis. Mimicry, more or less, is the performative adoption of specific cultural values from the colonizing culture\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In defining mimicry, Bhabha puts up an important limiting factor for such an act, “almost the same, but not quite.” Given the historicity, the distinctions and limiting factors that constitute colonial power, and the agency and ties of the colonized individual, the assimilative drive of DMV is never fully complete, one does not mesh themselves completely into the culture of the dominator and lose themselves completely. DMV portrays a partial mode of mimicry, but never a complete homogenization and unity of the colonized and colonizer\n",
      "\n",
      "2|From this observation though, I must distinguish between myself and Bhabha. While I am indebted to his reflection on the phenomena, the mimesis I describe does not touch on the disruptive factors to colonial power that Bhabha points to\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Rather, my interest is to what degree the cultural values of the colonizer were the object of imitation and assimilation as this is a work concerned with a specific historical socio-economic process. A more detailed discussion on Bhabha’s work will follow as I draw out DMV.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Disciplinary-Mimetic Valuation is, in the historical empirics of this analysis, the process in which European colonial states sought to assimilate (or “civilize”) the people it colonized into its universalist cultural value schema and the extent to which the colonized people attempted to assimilate into or mimic such. In the more general sense, it can be attributed to any power that seeks to assimilate another society into its socio-cultural schema by coercive force insofar as someone seeks to apply these principles to imperialist phenomena escaping European colonialism proper\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Thus, in the thrust of developing extractive colonial economies and building administrative systems to impose those desires, we have the foreground for DMV in action. What will follow throughout the rest of this work is understanding the ways DMV has played out in specific analyses\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Since it has a fundamental historical character, each incidence observed will have its proper contextual elements that provide unique aspects to the phenomena of Disciplinary-Mimetic Valuation. Furthermore, before any serious analysis begins, DMV is situated specifically and does not occur uniformly or simultaneously; it is fractional and the effects are prone to conflicts of that nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Syed Hussein Alatas starts us off in describing the starting point of this valuation, he points to a significant causal reason in the homogenization of cultural values to European colonizers. It develops from, what he considers, the fundamental source for orientalist mischaracterizations of Malays: their unwillingness to engage in colonial capitalism\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Alatas writes of the diminished attribution to natives, “Any type of labour which did not conform to this conception (capitalist timed labour) was rejected as a deviation. A community which did not enthusiastically and willingly adopt this conception of labour was regarded as indolent.” From this passage, we see the attributing of a negative image to function as a disciplinary tool\n",
      "\n",
      "2|First, we establish the point of invariance, the norm so to speak (A specific labor relation) Alatas points us to. Next, we note the difference in empirical adherence: the Dutch and English adhere to this type of labor, but the Native does not\n",
      "\n",
      "2|There next needs to be an explanation as to why this differential exists; we are left to question the moment and conditions of observation. Alatas does this for us as we are to recognize the material elements concerning Malay society, namely commercialized agriculture, “The root cause of this image was the Malays’ reaction to cash-crop agriculture and to working in colonial capitalist estates and plantations\n",
      "\n",
      "2|They avoided the most exploitative kind of labour in 19th century colonial capitalist undertakings.” Hence, there exists an industry in want of labor and a people unwilling to become subservient to it. The explanation for the differences, given proper context, is rooted in the satiation of economic processes in which a specific set of disciplined labor is necessary\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The characterization of Malays from European observers becomes centered around labor, Malays become “indolent and lazy,” as opposed to “industrious.” We see here a disciplinary tool in action, one aimed specifically at convincing the European reader of the inferiority of the native while also complementing the civilizing mission. We learn from this distinction that there are preliminary necessities for DMV to occur\n",
      "\n",
      "2|First, there must be a difference imbued with power differentials. Second, there requires in the dominating party a belief in their supposed superiority explicitly or implicitly held\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Alatas connects the image of the lazy Malay as an integral functionary in colonial ideology. Much to the same, DMV draws on a supporting ideology of superiority/inferiority of peoples.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|While Alatas points us to the proper requirements for the occurrence of DMV, we find its empirical implementation exploiting fractures in colonized societies existing in the works of Anthropologist Marshal Sahlins. Sahlins, in his analysis, is concerned predominantly with what he terms a structure of conjuncture or the reproduction of a culture that also transforms it and reinscribes new values to old cultural categories\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Sahlins sketches out a portrait of Hawaiian society organized around mana. Mana can roughly be described as power typically supernatural that legitimizes the right to rule\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Sahlins himself describes mana in several different ways. When describing pre-colonial mana, Sahlins writes that it was won from the great feat of the chiefs, “The mana of the chiefly heros is extraordinary, but more appropriate to a human sphere than were the supernatural gifts of their predecessors\n",
      "\n",
      "1|The chiefs win success by their subtlety, courage, skill and strength.” Sahlins gives another description of mana saying, “mana is the creative power Hawaiians describe as making visible what is invisible, causing things to be seen, which is the same as making them known or giving them form.” From this, we can see a high prioritization for the acquisition and accumulation of mana.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Now, Sahlins describes the receiving of Europeans on Hawaiians own cultural terms and through their adjustment and adaptation of their cultural schema. Following the thread on mana, European goods and people were considered to possess considerable mana and was used for appropriation to reinforce or disrupt precolonial structures prevalent within Hawaiian society. For example, the killing of Captain Cook represents the appropriation of mana and the interrelation of it to Englishness:\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Through the appropriation of Cook’s bones, the mana of the Hawaiian kingship itself became British. And long after the English as men lost their godliness, the Hawaiian gods kept their Englishness. Moreover, the effect was to give the British a presence in Hawaiian affairs that was all out of proportion to their actual presence in Hawaiian waters, since they were rapidly displaced in the sandalwood trade by the Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|From this we can see the mimetic effects quite clearly, while retaining their own conceptual and cosmological categories, they begin to be partially adopted by the Hawaiians. Interestingly enough, Sahlins makes note of the economic withdrawal of British in the area, yet the presence of their cultural influence prevails despite the waning of hard British power. The disciplinary aspects, instead, become enforced by the own cosmological categories of the Hawaiians themselves and give way to the fractious exploitation of DMV. First, it did so by legitimizing Kamehameha’s conquest of the Hawaiian Islands and his European policy of friendship with the British; Sahlins writes:\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Further, the chiefs even started to act and imitate the British themselves as a means of perpetuating and reinforcing their social dominance from their subjects. Clothing was of particular importance:\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Conversely, European interaction with the Hawaiians also led to conflict between the chiefs and the commoners. First, the commoners themselves had competing economic interests that ran converse to chiefly tabus on trade\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Commoners had explicit interest in the accumulation of European mana observable in the exchange of sexual labor of the natives for European goods. Even in open hostility following Cook’s death, these relations still held in secrecy\n",
      "\n",
      "1|In short, Sahlins summarizes the fractious effect of European contact on Hawaiian society; he writes:\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The respective relations of chiefs and people to the European presence thus set them in practical opposition to one another. The complex exchanges that developed between Hawaiians and Europeans…brought the former into uncharacteristic conditions of internal conflict and contradiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Sahlins portrays the structure of conjuncture though not as an assimilative or mimetic experience, but one in which the Hawaiian social order appropriates these interactions to reassert and recast itself. I depart from this conjecture only insofar as the recasting and resetting of the Hawaiian social ordering produced mimetic effects, namely in the chiefdom, of European cultural distinctions\n",
      "\n",
      "2|I emphasize heavily that the mimetic effects themselves are not all-consuming or even prominent at the early stages of colonial contact, but are ultimately partial. The stipulation that Europeans had superior mana and the dependencies those created established the base means for DMV’s internal logic to take root\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Discipliniarity itself started in repositioning and fracturing of Hawaiian power and its social order.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Bhabha’s conception of hybridity may help us elucidate further how cultural mimesis in DMV works. Bhabha holds that postcolonial subjects exist at the “in-between” or “splitting” of cultural consciousness that inevitably places the colonized subject in a state of hybridity by creating a unique space of enunciation, “The social articulation of difference, from the minority perspective, is a complex, on-going negotiation that seeks to authorize cultural hybridities that emerge in moments of historical transformation.” What these postcolonial hybridities necessitate is some degree of mimicry for them to be constituted as a hybridized entity otherwise the very notion of a hybridized postcolonial identity fails to obtain\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Mimicry, for Bhabha, creates an alternative knowledge or viewpoint within the cultural schema that simultaneously threatens its relation to truth concerning colonial images. Bhabha writes, “It is the process of fixation of the colonial as a form of cross-classificatory, discriminatory knowledge within an interdictory discourse and therefore necessarily raises the question of the authorization of colonial representation.” Hence, Bhabha sees in mimicry a way of undermining and de-authorizing negative colonial images and there is some truth in this\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Insofar as DMV operates though, its mimesis first signals a capitulation and perhaps one that is unavoidable of the precolonial consciousness. I read Bhabha’s conception of mimicry as starting from an initial departure and transformation (although not necessarily self-conscious as Sahlins’s analysis of the Hawaiians shows) of the precolonial culture to become more amenable to the dominating one.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|If Sahlins points to the early and fractious implementation of DMV, Chatterjee draws it out in more substantial and concrete terms when he describes the nationalist response to British occupation: a necessary privacy of the inner or spiritual domain of culture and the homogenization of the outer domain. Chatterjee’s analysis of Indian Nationalism points us to understanding DMV as it operates in nationalist contestation; disciplining the outer presentation while never quite penetrating the privacy of the spiritual domain\n",
      "\n",
      "2|To understand the proper context in which Chatterjee introduces these concepts, we need to understand that Chatterjee postulates an idea of colonial difference that operates quite agreeably with the characterization of the civilizing mission and Alatas’ observations. Chatterjee covers some debates among British intellectuals and colonial administrators in relation to liberal and conservative colonial policy as they perceive colonial difference\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Prior to the development of Hindu nationalism, India was subjected to the Rule of Colonial Difference which set race as its distinguishing marker. Such rule justified the conservative tendency to perceive the British colonial subjects as incapable of self-rule while simultaneously throwing the universalist claims of British liberalism into question\n",
      "\n",
      "2|If the colonized subjects of the British Empire are incapable of self-rule based on differences according to race, the universalist mission of juridical liberal rights, equal protection under the law, and property come into direct conflict with the realities of colonial rule and discourse. Chatterjee himself makes note of this when considering Ripon’s failure in the Ilbert Bill affair, “What his ‘failure’ signaled was the inherent impossibility of completing the project of the modern state without superseding the conditions of colonial rule.” The immediate tension being, again, the so-called applicability of universalist values confronted with the epistemic and material alienation of the colonized and the discursive justification for their occupation\n",
      "\n",
      "1|For colonized India, this meant adopting some of the material habits that fall into line with an enlightened, liberal criteria of humanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Hence, for the modern state to succeed in its mission, it needed to grant the conditions that fundamentally led to the disavowal of colonial rule itself. There needs to be some degree of mimetic or assimilative adjustment in the colonized culture to give way to the modern state\n",
      "\n",
      "2|For Chatterjee, This begins with the spiritual and material modernization of the Indian national consciousness; this is also where we can find the machinations of DMV. It is most obvious in the material domain which Chatterjee distinguishes as, “the domain of law, administration, economy, and statecraft.” The homogenization and erasure of difference in this domain of culture shows the ascription of the administrative, legal, and economic aspects of Indian society into the teleological cultural schema of the Enlightenment\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The modernization of the Indian state becomes pegged to abstract European notions of progress and development. We see in the material realm the purest form of DMV as the Indian economy begins to resemble Europe in administrative structure and economy\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Chatterjee writes:\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In this, it seemed to be reasserting precisely the claims to universality of the modern regime of power. And in the end, by successfully terminating the life of the colonial state, nationalism demonstrated that the project…could be carried forward only by superseding the conditions of colonial rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|If in the outer domain, we can see the adoption of British material values, The Inner-Domain (language, religion, family and personal life) represents the exemplification of the partiality of mimesis. In the inner-domain, the nationalistic India posits the alternative knowledge that Bhabha gives, it creates a conception of Indian-ness as a legalistic and political equal once independence is achieved\n",
      "\n",
      "2|However, these inner-distinctions themselves do not completely escape the influence of disciplinarity either through modular forms of expression (like the novel) or through institutional arrangements like the university system. More explicitly, we can see the effect of DMV reproducing the same class distinctions in post-colonial states that, although not exclusively occupied by a nationalistic middle class, lends itself to their expression by way of material domination\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Chatterjee demonstrates this explicitly with his analysis on Bankim’s nationalism; he writes on the prospect of Bankim’s consideration of a true Bengali history, “The historical consciousness he is seeking to invoke is in no way an ‘indigenous’ consciousness’ because the preferred discursive form of his historiography is modern European.” Coupled with Bankim’s antipathy for Muslims and their representation of India, we can see mimesis and acculturative practices touching the inner aspect of nationalistic consciousness; the modular and methodological forms of transmission were instrumental at this point of contact.

In particular, the othering of the Muslim is complementary with western orientalist renderings of Islam in general; Islam is portrayed as a functionary of stagnation and is given a “medieval” characterization in the nationalistic consciousness\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Muslims become, “fanatical, bigoted, warlike, dissolute, and cruel.” Hence, DMV can also lead to the articulation of negative images shared in common with the dominating power. It is important to note that the mimesis of Bhabha draws heavily from his concept of cultural hybridization that is antithetical to nationalism itself; it is another distinction I draw from what I interpret as mimicry\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Overall though, while partiality is given, the inner domain of culture is not entirely immune from DMV’s influence.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Nothing gives a more explicit portrayal of the intersections of mimesis and coercion than the first chapter of Black Skin, White Masks. Fanon portrays such a process as it inheres on the Black colonized subject and France and points explicitly to the opportunities it allows for individuals suffering under colonial occupation. In this particular occurrence, we can see Bhabha’s postulation of, “almost the same, but not quite.” Fanon points to unique material opportunities that are provided through the adoption of the colonizer culture, “The colonized is elevated above his jungle status in proportion to his adoption of the mother country’s cultural standards…In the Senegalese regiments, the black officers serve first of all as interpreters.” However, it is not only material opportunities, like that of an interpreter, that gives rise to mimesis, but also a feeling of psychological factors that contribute to a feeling of equality:\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Both of the reasoning for the adoption of European cultural values stems from the disciplining of racist images of colonial rule onto the colonized, Mimicry supposes an alternative way to remove the brutalizing force of colonial occupation and racism. Fanon, himself, asserts this when he writes, “Historically, it must be understood that the Negro wants to speak French because it is the key that can open doors which were still barred to him fifty years ago.” This mimetic pathway, however, is limited by the persistence of colonial difference still present in the consciousness of racist Europeans and the internal splitting that is required from the minority consciousness when faced with marginalization\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The partiality of mimesis is not only preserved by the internal conditions of the colonized consciousness, but also supported by the vestiges of colonial difference be it presented in explicit and historical understandings of race and skin color or disparate material outcomes. Thus, DMV never completes the disciplining to the dominating culture, it cannot because complete homogenization eliminates any notion of mimesis\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Rather, if we were to deny the inner domain of the colonized subject, we would only be speaking of absorption. Returning to Chatterjee, we can find a similar thought:\n",
      "\n",
      "2|A relational opposition of power necessarily meant that the dominated had to be granted their own domain of subjectivity, where they were autonomous, undominated. If it were not so, the dominators would, in the exercise of their domination, wholly consume and obliterate the dominated.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Instead, partiality is preserved and with it a split consciousness: one in which the disciplining powers of the dominant European culture operates and influences, but never fully takes hold. This is because the historical markers of colonial difference that initially gave way to the discursive justification for domination, disciplining, and extraction persist and are realized to this day; what started this process also prevents its completion.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|I have demonstrated a fragmented account of a theory of cultural valuation that in and of itself is not entirely complete. Nor could it be, it requires fundamentally contextualized historical readings and interpretative accounts of European colonialism. Rather, as a theory of value it strives to fundamentally rethink how economic value is constituted. What will follow now is a reflection on some questions that might have relevance to this theory and its placement in the economics discourse.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Perhaps a prominent question is what distinguishes DMV from anthropological and sociological accounts of acculturation. DMV itself might be seen as a particular theoretical application of acculturation and I have no qualms with this, but I would stress unique markers of this theory and the potential of it for further work\n",
      "\n",
      "2|First, I draw upon a tradition of poststructuralist and postcolonial thought to inform some of the ontological basis for this theory. First, I appropriate Foucault’s notions of disciplinary and bio-power and do the same for Bhabha’s mimicry\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In particular, poststructuralist readings tend to draw significantly from semiotic accounts of signification. Sahlins, who is far from a post-structuralist, also recognizes the importance of sign analysis when he considers the following on value:\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The value of any cultural category whatever such as ‘land’ is indeed arbitrary in the sense that it is constituted on principled distinctions among signs which, in relation to objects, are never the only possible distinctions. Even an ecological anthropology would recognize that the extent to which a particular tract of land is a ‘productive resource,’ if it is at all, depends on the cultural order in place. Economics might thus find a place in the general semiology that Saussure envisioned—while at the same time hedging the entrance requirement with restrictive clauses.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Second, I am primarily concerned with the colonial situation in developing this theory, but do not see it exclusively applicable to that situation. Thus, if this theory is to be designated as just another theory of acculturation; I would prefer it be one rendered in the connecting of Economics to cultural values on a poststructuralist and postcolonial ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|What remains is how this theory can be integrated into an emancipatory politics. Bhabha certainly recognizes hybridity as the fundamental ontological grounding of the postcolonial world and I am inclined to agree with him because the sheer material and historical effects of colonialism appear to be cemented in the international world and the emergence of new social identities\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Rather, I see Bhabha as expressing a social reality and find that the notion of a hybridized social identity itself points to a new individualism that supplants the European rationalistic one. This individual follows no rational choice theory, does not give way to the clear mathematical formalization of neoclassical economics and their subsequent limitations, but rather draws from a variety of historical situations and identities that contextualizes and situates decision making\n",
      "\n",
      "1|It is not a totalizing individuality; the economic individual becomes contextualized and situated in a variety of cultural nexuses that resists the invariances of economic theories of value and the oppressive fixing of cultural differences necessary for a rationalization on the colonial rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|However, work still needs to be done. Kaul calls upon bringing the cultural politics of recognition to theories of value overall which I do not believe I have adequately done\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Given this is a fragmented, incomplete, and non-exclusive theory, there is also considerable expansion and revision necessary for it to achieve proper clarity and rigor. There is also room to develop more extensive, complementary or antagonistic theories of value\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Furthermore, there exists work to be done that far escapes the reaches of my thought and I am only a historically situated individual. So, to answer the question about how this theory can be integrated into an emancipatory politics, I answer that it provides the basis for new theorizing and new histories that provide the theoretical basis for such a politics, while fundamentally displacing a Eurocentric universalism premised on a culturally specific reading of rationality.\n",

John Dower explains that there are eight critical reasons why the United States succeeded in rebuilding Japan: “Discipline, moral legitimacy, well-defined and well-articulated objectives, a clear chain of command, tolerance and flexibility in policy formulation and implementation, confidence in the ability of the state to act constructively, the ability to operate abroad free of partisan politics back home, and the existence of a stable, resilient, sophisticated civil society on the receiving end of occupation policies – these political and civic virtues helped make it possible to move decisively during the brief window of a few years when defeated Japan itself was in flux and most receptive to radical change.”[22] The most important of these (for Japanese) was “the existence of a stable, resilient, sophisticated civil society”[22] that did not dwell on the past\n",

      "2|Japanese people invested their efforts in improving the country by working for the government instead of pursuing individual entrepreneur-driven innovation. World War destroyed close to 40% of Japan’s industrial infrastructure, but following the war the country was able to equip itself with newer and more advanced infrastructure.[10] This made Japanese workers more efficient and capable compared to labor in many other countries in the world\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The government's extreme focus on channeling the new flood of labor, who were formerly in the military, into Keiretsu centralized advancement into specific business conglomerates and transferred the responsibility of keeping good working conditions to Keiretsu. The Zaibatsu were one of MacArthur’s biggest targets initially\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Under the original plan for reorganization, he wanted to completely dissolve large commercial conglomerates. In his view, the Zaibatsu acted for themselves and spreading wealth out was more beneficial\n",
      "\n",
      "2|By that point, laborers grew accustomed to working for large and stable businesses. When the Zaibatsu collapsed, instead of looking for more self-reliance and independent employment workers went simply to work for new corporations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|MacArthur was following a “new deal” type program that in his view would make a more efficient workforce by diversifying industries and taking advantage of the returning working population. While he successfully eliminated several Zaibatsu, many just reformed into looser cross-shareholding Keiretsu. During the occupation six Keiretsu became the most influential: Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Fuyo, Sanwa and Dai-Ichi.[25] These Keiretsu distinguished themselves from others by all being centered to one bank, and the bank loaned money to member companies in the Keiretsu while also holding equity positions in the Keiretsu companies.[26] Close relationship between the banks, companies and government regulators eventually became an insurmountable detriment to the lower-class workforce.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|MacArthur started labor reform from the distribution of property in the land redistribution act. The reform’s purpose was to redistribute land from landlords who did not individually use the land to the low-class workers who rented the land and actually used it.[23] Although many believe this event acted as a de-industrializer of the labor force, it is important to understand the reform did not affect a majority of working Japanese. The land reform only helped solidify the path of corporate labor because by 1965, mining, construction and manufacturing accounted for 41% of the labor force, while agriculture only employed 26% of the population.[10] The land reform acted both as and industrial and political policy.[24] Although the policy had little effect on agricultural output, it dramatically increased the amount of conservative thinking in the urban population.[24]\n",
      "\n",
      "2|A majority of economic reform pinned regular Japanese citizens as the backbone for success. In return, the society structured itself to guarantee a job for any hardworking and willing citizen, cementing the decade-long practice of prioritizing corporate vs individual employment\n",
      "\n",
      "2|It was a special modification on the social contract, which had been in place for a while, and it helped solidify the reputation in the West that Japanese citizens love work in an uncompromising way. In order to return to a strong economic footing, the government revived traditional values of shame, sacrifice, responsibility and wise decision making.[21] The effort by the government is often described as an “iron triangle” where large corporations had easy financial breaks, yet they had to pay large prices for resources and make sure their labor force was well serviced.[9] This brings about one of the greatest contradictions to present “Western” economic strategies\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In “Western” countries, the government more often over regulates the financial system and ignores the workers. An American strategy is making sure the key economic drivers are fair in hope it will eventually benefit the poor\n",
      "\n",
      "2|However, the Japanese took a different rout inspired by Roosevelt’s “new deal” and motivated the general workforce to better the large corporate institutions. The new corporations understood that a motivated labor force could be well trained and given pay incentives.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Japanese people had put national GDP growth as their foremost personal priority.[30] Through the corporation's desire for capable labor, the government no longer had to worry about a social welfare net.[9] The “economic miracle” could not have been achieved without the costs the United States government incurred from reconstructing Japan. The United States made sure to sufficiently fund Japanese defense spending well until the end of the Cold War\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Also, a complete rebuilding of infrastructure helped the Japanese government focus on molding its labor force. However, in the long-term, Japanese people are still suffering today from the initial labor policies.[9] If a stronger effort had been put into incentivizing self- employment, Japan would have taken a slower but more robust path to economic recovery\n",
      "\n",
      "1|There is almost no social security or pension fund for retirees.[9] To the present day, a large portion of Japan’s population is elderly and the child fertility rate is low due to the young generation’s urgency for having a stable position in the unforgiving labor market.\n",

      "\n",
      "2|The Labor Standards Act has 13 chapters which outline necessary work conditions for human beings.[28] An important inclusion of the act are wage and labor contract provisions. The Trade Union Act made sure workers had the ability to organize and assemble.[29]\n",

      "2|Following the U.S. withdrawal, a functioning, well-educated urban professional class, strong bureaucracy and effective agriculture put the country on track for a 5% economic growth rate compared to the U.S.’s 3.8% by the 1980’s.[10] While United States reform was necessary to rebuild the manufacturing sector to pre-war conditions, the motivated and highly educated labor force did a majority of the work\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Japan also had a fast modernization of technology due to substantiated corporate investment.[10] The overall system worked on “arbitrary motivation,” where companies were able to attract capable employees with new technology and promise of promotion. The corporations were growing so fast they could guarantee senior positions to almost all employees\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Although there was no long-term capacity for management positions, the lifetime employment system made sure that only employees approaching retirement received positions. Also, the companies were so well endowed with resources, they could meaninglessly fill high paying positions with no regard of valuable yield\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Recent studies have shown that the Japanese population's propensity to spend helped drive the economic recovery.[30] These claims fall perfectly into the other established characteristics of the Japanese economy for two main reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|First, the well trained and motivated workers had very good wages. In the 1960s, a combination of low population growth and increased industrialization resulted in increased wages.[10] Second, low interest rates that were used for rapid growth benefited individual spending habits\n",
      "\n",
      "2|At the same time the workers who participated in the lifelong employment system had a friendly relationship with higher management, which allowed for very few labor disputes.[30] This also can be seen as a perpetuator of the Japanese spending habit. The promise of greater financial gains during the later years of a citizen’s career was too tempting, and it led to a demise of the riskier possibility of entrepreneurship\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In fact, as supported by statistical data on the number of internal migrants in Japan from 1954 to 2004 (Table 2-37-a in reference [37]), the total number of internal migrants began to decline from 8,026,029 in 1974, and this downward trend continued through 2004 with almost 30% reduction reaching 5,771,921 migrants. This demographic indicator of population mobility, as a proxy for economic opportunism, provides indirect evidence of sustained transition to a less entrepreneurial workforce in Japan, which underpins the beginning of lifelong employment dominance in the 80s as one of the important precursors for the “lost decade.” Companies essentially guaranteed workers higher pay alongside job security as time went on making people more inclined to spend\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The political system from the 1950s to 2000 can’t be ignored as Japan has been in control by one party (LDP), which advocated for conservative policies favoring business growth.[30] The LDP’s long standing and consistent platform further benefited workers’ security because the party kept close economic ties with the United States. Despite the Cold War sucking funds away from nations, the keiretsu were safe since the United States was still a reliable consumer of new technologies\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The labor system which was so focused on education and motivation also painted its own destiny and security. Other global nations recognized the quality and reliability of Japanese exports, giving an international brand to companies such as Sony and Nintendo.[30]\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The system which closely relied on uniform loyal participation from the labor force could not last forever. In the 1970s extreme environmental pollution accompanied by an environment of overworking and stress became a political issue.[10] The social contract in Japan had rapidly changed for centuries and at this point work was intolerable\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The success of both the industrialized and agricultural economies heavily relied on the success of the labor market, with labor efficiency being undoubtedly the largest factor when considering the nation's propensity to export. In most well developed nations there are two limiting factors when considering successful international trade: an available buyer and an ability to efficiently manufacture\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Japan’s guaranteed buyer was the U.S., but Japan pinned its entire industrial capability on its labor force, which for a long time ultra-efficiently manufactured goods. However, Japanese people no longer agreed that economic success should be the national policy.[30] Both Japanese workers and corporations understood the value of the lifelong employment system\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Even though economic stressors such as the oil shock tested the reliability of the economy, quick recoveries from large production covered up the issues that would become apparent later. It continued to satisfy the workers' desire for job security and helped businesses by making training easy and loyalty a standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In response to growing displeasure of outdated policy by the labor force, the Liberal Democratic Party passed more social reforms to help create a larger safety net.[30] People quickly benefited from the high growth era in the 1980s with a growing stock market and strong real estate market.[30] The Keiretsu grew quickly out of the banking success stemming from Japanese people’s spending. Japanese society saw the growth as having a negative effect on the people, associating excessive spending with a loss of traditional values.[30] Japanese citizens of all ages preferred a humble lifestyle with no excesses that often come with personal success, and this provided a social background for negative perception of people striving for independent success\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In an exaggerated way, it was as if people had tirelessly worked for 20 years then excessively reaped the benefits. A society that had been so focused on maintaining a neutral social structure as a mechanism for post-war national recovery evolved to establish a more distinct class structure than ever before\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This is corroborated by statistical data on Japanese households’ income from side work, i.e., outside of primary employment, which can be used as a proxy for the diversity of economic activity among the population (Table 2-22 in reference [37]). The data shows that the number of households with “side business activity” peaked at 123,772 in 1970\n",
      "\n",
      "2|By 1980, ten years later, the number of households dropped to 85,243. This suggests a trend of reduced entrepreneurial activity in population, which is typically stimulated by having sufficient number of workers seeking new income opportunities, in addition or instead of favoring stable employment at large corporations.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Nonetheless, as Japanese people bought more homes, banks saw the sky as the limit, issuing incredible amounts of loans, not all of which that were secure. Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman states \"Japan's banks lent more, with less regard for quality of the borrower, than anyone else's\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In so doing they helped inflate the bubble economy to “grotesque proportions\".[32] Banks were forced to issue more loans because large corporations grew too big and had to search for other places to finance their capital from bigger foreign banks.[30] Banks felt that due to the lifelong employment system they were relatively safe in issuing mass loans due to the strong job security most people had possessed. When the bubble eventually burst, the labor system was undoubtedly one of the biggest perpetrators in the collapse\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Despite the loan bonanza enjoyed by large corporation, the banks did not invest as much into new businesses that could provide engine for economic growth and new opportunities. Statistical data (Table 14-8 in reference [37]) shows that during the 90s and early 2000s Shoko Chukin Bank, Credit Cooperation and Shinkumi Federation Bank actually decreased loans and deposits for small businesses\n",
      "\n",
      "2|By 2003, these three banks, in addition to Shinkin Central Bank, Labour Credit Association and the National Federation of Labor Credit Associations all together issued fewer than 100,000 loans a year to new business ventures. In essence, the large banks had lost confidence in the potential for small businesses to succeed\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This decrease in loans took place despite a major decrease in a number of reported bankruptcies in late 80’s, with a staggering ~75% drop in just 5 years between 1985 and 1990 (Table 6-17 in reference [37]). One can suggest that this decrease indicates a healthier economic climate which helps new businesses survive; however, since its onset occurred in 1985 when the economy of big enterprises started to collapse, the “positive” trend most likely is another indicator of a dramatic slowdown in entrepreneurial activity in Japan, simply because small businesses are much more susceptible to bankruptcy\n",
      "\n",
      "1|In turn, this led to a reduced diversity and increased bureaucratization of the economy with more workers favoring employment at large corporations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|The decrease in private ventures from bankruptcies in the 1980s is also displayed in data showing the number of private institutions. Beginning 1981, the number of privately owned enterprises and individual proprietorships stagnated and slowly decreased by the thousands, especially in Aomori, Iwate, Akita, Tokyo, Ishikawa, Kyoto and Osaka (Table 6-8 in reference [37]. At the same time, the number of corporations and joint stock companies saw a dramatic increase. This further supports a conclusion that entrepreneurialism was no longer viewed as a viable path to achieve economic success and societal preference towards the risk averse economic development relying on larger corporations and stable labor employment policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|When examining the reason for the unchecked growth many economists agree that inept public policy, corruption, greed, and sentiment that Japan was \"different\" were root causes.[30] As previously mentioned, the central bank kept interest rates low forcing banks to give out more speculative loans in order to maintain growth levels. However, pressure from the United States to maintain a competitive domestic industry through politics of weakening the U.S\n",
      "\n",
      "2|dollar forced the Japanese government to rapidly increase its interest rates, which made risky borrowers unable to pay back loans. Japanese regulators were too close to the banks since bureaucrats weren't paid well and often decided that working for a large bank would be more profitable.[30] This issue stemmed out of the rigid labor practices because most of the salary increases were in private corporations while government jobs offered a low retirement age\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Thus, government regulators were able to retire early and profit at Keiretsu. This fostered an environment where bureaucrats would focus their time to establishing good relationships with banks in order to guarantee a well-paid position after retirement.[30] Not only did such relationships promote a conflict of interest for regulators before retirement, it also meant they had very good connections and abusive strategies when working for banks after retirement\n",
      "\n",
      "1|When the bubble eventually burst, growth became so dismal that huge corporations people called \"too big to fail\" were forced to scrap their system of obtaining domestic human capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Japanese corporations had to cut costs, let go of useless workers and move expensive manufacturing to other countries.[30] Loyalty from workers became unimportant when a company is struggled to stay afloat, and senior management positions which provided no value could no longer be tolerated. To maximize labor efficiency part time employment proliferated, which meant the end of low unemployment rates and financial security to workers\n",
      "\n",
      "2|By 2009, non-permanent employees constituted more than 30% of the work force.[31] A massive stagnation in wages meant that workers could not spend money to stimulate the economy, and the rapid transition from low to high then back to low interest rates hurt the labor market structure. Savers and retirees were ruined due to their dependence on accumulating funds, which stopped following the collapse.[30] In a country with a large elderly population and low fertility rate, the low interest rates make a well paying and reliable job even more important\n",
      "\n",
      "2|However, the leading corporations now outsource a large fraction of labor and are always looking for cheap labor rather than investing in domestic human capital. This pattern will likely persist as Japan enters the next Asian free trade agreement, making cheap transactions easier within the region\n",
      "\n",
      "1|The crisis disabled long-term political solutions throughout the 1990s as the country constantly elected different leaders with no long-term vision.[30]\n",
      "\n",
      "4|One of the crisis's overlooked impact is the social change it caused. People have not only given up looking for stable employment, but also given up on life all together. Stories are widespread of young people who don't see education as a useful tool and are pressured by the unstable job market lock themselves in their parents’ room and withdraw from society. Although the private sector's inability to stimulate better conditions for development of domestic human capital do not always lead to extreme cases such as that, Japanese standard of living and happiness levels have significantly plummeted.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|After a half century of unstable economic climate, the Japanese people have found a resurgence in nationalistic and self-sufficient thinking. Japanese leaders have seen close economic and defense relationships with the U.S\n",
      "\n",
      "2|as the best means of achieving high growth. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has taken a very different approach to returning Japan onto the mainstage of global economic superpowers\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Abe's plan, commonly named \"Abenomics\", aims to use three \"arrows\" -- monetary policy, fiscal policy and economic growth strategy -- to increase private investment.[33] Abe's plan relies heavily on changing how the labor force traditionally thinks in Japan by transforming the social priority given to saving into spending, much like in the 1980s. Although many economists have agreed that Japan's macroeconomic situation is nearly unmanageable due to interest rates already at zero, Abenomics specifically sets negative interest rates to help push Japanese workers into entrepreneurship\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This policy is one of Abe's hardest to be successful due to historical instability of monetary policy and cultural norms in Japan. Fluctuations of the capital market go against the cultural desire for stability over everything else\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The government's inability to be consistent on maintaining interest rates and excessive focus on large corporations to remain stable puts pressure on regular middle class Japanese. It will be incredibly difficult for the government to find a way to dispel its past troubles especially since large businesses still dominate the financial sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|For trust between people and government to emerge, Abe will have to either provide further tax incentives for small businesses or establish stronger regulations on large corporations. However, for either to work, he needs to create something similar to China's five year plan, which Japan used to rely on, where a commitment to the policy is laid out because otherwise people will fear that the tax breaks or low interest rates won't last long enough to develop their business idea\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Nonetheless, even if Abe can do both of these things, the cultural barrier will present a steep obstacle. In Japan, those who do too much to stand out are looked down upon in a society that tries its hardest to be “the most normal.” Not surprisingly, the allure of the lifetime employment system still has young workers hoping they can catch the tailwind of this dying trend\n",
      "\n",
      "1|To succeed, Abe must show that individual employment opportunities will be more stable long-term than the corporate ones, and a culture of economic individualism does not negate the possibility of a fair social contract that broadly benefit everyone and the society as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Instead of discouraging people who have potential to make Japan more prosperous, the country has to buy into the idea of a national goal similar to the post-war dogma. Abe's best plan to tackle the pressure that large corporations project on government would be to limit the government's bending to corporate \"screw-ups\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This would cement a free market approach with basic government planning, show entrepreneurs the government is committed to a leveled economic field with equal opportunities and encourage large corporations to be more scrupulous. For the \"monetary policy\" arrow to hit its mark in promoting growth through low interest rate investments, Abe has to develop a more aggressive foreign policy\n",
      "\n",
      "2|By decreasing interest rates further, Japan will see a rise in inflation. This will serve to lower the cost of domestic goods, which can be used to create a larger international trade surplus\n",
      "\n",
      "2|I would like to emphasize that this is a short term policy to stimulate growth, which will have to be corrected if growth becomes excessive. That being said in the short term this should help not only promote growth via export, but should also eventually increase wages, thus promoting demand in Japanese markets\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Japan's lifetime employment system must also change. The system works only during a period of high growth, due to more tolerance to inefficiencies during the growth periods, and it can only be managed with an excess of wealth\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The Ministry of Internal Affairs estimates there are currently 25 million company workers between the ages of late 40s and mid 60s, and in Japan the most productive age is 45, which endangers the company's profitability.[34] The lifetime labor system guarantees pay increases as you get older, so in a time of small or negative growth an excess of money is wasted on inefficient older workers. The excess of employees in pointless management positions has yielded a new term oidashi beya which means “expulsion room.”[35] The system targets workers in their 30s and 40s, people who were lucky to find lifetime employment during the “lost decade.”[35] Companies have no easy way to shed excess labor due to the lifetime employment system and are forced to find ways to make employees quit\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Transferring workers to useless departments and social disconnection emerged as passive methods of encouraging workers to leave. While this is an obvious example that could be used by Abe’s government to demonstrate the fundamental deficiencies of the existing corporate culture in Japan, it has the potential to create the unintended effect of being a social stressor\n",
      "\n",
      "1|If Abe chooses to emphasize this as the largest consequence of Japanese corporate labor, it could paralyze people instead of forcing them to change their views on employment,\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Historically, statistical data shows that the Japanese government has been slow to address the social climate from a young age. Data (Table 26-24 in reference [37]) shows that although the overall number of educational classes, training courses and events increased until 2005, the youth leaders’ training category experienced a massive decline\n",

      "\n",
      "2|The largest challenge to Japan will be selling the deal to voters.[36] The deal will put heavy pressure on small scale labor, such as farming or low-skill workers, because of the intense competition from other countries with lower labor costs (China). The next free trade agreement will be the final strike onto the weak permanent employment system\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Corporations will have even easier access to labor in other countries where it is not only cheaper but requires no permanent commitments. This should not be a surprise, since for the last decade large Japanese corporations have already efficiently outsourced labor\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Corporate outsourcing could have a positive impact by directly forcing Japanese workers to seek new opportunities. Despite the negative effects the deal will have short term, it will accomplish what Abe set out to do-to: jumpstart the stagnant Japanese economy by giving more opportunities for Japan to increase its exports\n",

      "\n",
      "2|Abe’s greatest challenge will be balancing corporate power and the supply of domestic labor. Through free trade, Japanese corporations will want to reduce expensive Japanese labor and expand production to other countries\n",

      "2|In addition to promoting domestic entrepreneurship Abe will have to find a way to make it favorable for Japanese corporations to hire from the domestic workforce and domestic manufacturing base.

      "2|The only way this is feasible is by making corporate taxes competitive with the other members of a free trade agreement and making improvements to the education system.

      "2|By using an incentives/disincentives model to map the divergent behaviors of multinational corporations (MNCs) confronted by a sanctioned economy, I explain why some economic sanctions work better than others at achieving their desired political outcomes. When presented with the opportunity to \"run the blockade,\" MNCs are incentivized to sanction bust by the allure of higher profit through rent extraction\n",
      "\n",
      "2|At the same time, MNCs are disincentivized to sanction bust by the penalties for breaking the sanction, but only if MNCs believe sanction busting operations is inconspicuous enough to avoid detection. If the incentives to sanction bust outweigh the disincentives not to, then MNCs will trade with sanctioned states, as was the case with Rhodesia\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Since MNCs were crucial to both the Rhodesian and the South African economies – as it provided oil to the former and operated a significant minority of the firms in the latter – the decisions of MNCs to remain engaged in Rhodesia and to disengage from South Africa had a significant impact on the economic and political life of the two apartheid regimes. Hence, while many economic and political indicators identified by literature predicted that Rhodesia would have a shorter life expectancy under economic sanctions, Rhodesia defied all expectations and survived twice as long as South Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Since the end of the Cold War, economic sanctions have been used to discourage \"any actions of a targeted nation that the targeting nation or group of nations disagree with.\"2 Indeed, in just the last 25 years, the U.N. Security Council has authorized 24 economic sanctions; prior to 1990, the U.N. authorized only two.3 Furthermore, \"between 1960 and 1990, most of the sanctions were imposed unilaterally, most frequently by the United States, but in the 1990s, a large fraction was imposed by intergovernmental coalitions.\"4\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Given the sudden popularity of economic sanctions as a policy instrument, many scholars have studied it. But despite the proliferation of literatures on economic sanctions, few studies have compared the impact of economic sanctions against Rhodesia and South Africa on the political resolution of Apartheid\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This gap in literature is surprising, because a comparison of the two Apartheid regimes under sanction allows for a great \"most-similar cases\" research design, in which most exogenous variables that may affect the result are kept constant. Rhodesia and South Africa were both post–colonial Apartheid states with resource extraction economies\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Both states received a comprehensive U.N. sanction regime that banned the trade of nearly all goods with nearly all nations\n",
      "\n",
      "2|But Rhodesian Apartheid held out for 15 years under sanction, while South African Apartheid barely survived seven. Why is there such a big difference in the effectiveness of sanctions?\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Conventional literature points to state-centric factors, like differences in political systems or macroeconomic structures. Such factors fail to answer the question. Political and macroeconomic divergences between the Apartheids states were either nonexistent, or predicted that Rhodesia – not South Africa – would be weakened more by sanctions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Instead, the key to understanding the mystery must be sought in non–state actors: the MNC. Rather than differences in state-centric factors, the divergent decisions of MNCs to sanction bust in Rhodesia – but not in South Africa – decided the fates of the two Apartheid states\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Rational and profit-maximizing actors, the MNCs made this crucial decision by weighing the incentives and disincentives of sanction busting in a process that considers profitability, punishment, and conspicuousness. On one hand, the prospects of capturing large rents from sanctioned economies and hence earning high profits gave MNCs an incentive to run the blockade\n",
      "\n",
      "2|On the other hand, the penalties threatened for disobeying the sanction regime dissuades MNCs from sanction busting, but only if the MNCs were caught. Like people, MNCs will respect laws only if they are enforced, and laws are enforceable only if the offenses are discovered\n",
      "\n",
      "2|MNCs will sanction bust if and only if the incentives to do so outweigh disincentives not to. The Rhodesia/South Africa story has broader implications: policymakers should consider not just state-centric factors, but also the micro economies that regulate the incentives and disincentives for sanction busting\n",

      "3|Rhodesia and South Africa were both British colonies with a long history of racial segregation that endowed political, economic, and social privileges to the white settler‒colonist minorities at the expense of the indigenous African majority. In both countries, whites had suffrage, Africans did not; Whites farmed expropriated land, Africans were expelled to agriculturally unproductive areas; whites enjoyed access to higher education, Africans did not. These racist policies, collectively referred to as Apartheid policies, would provoke international outcry and economic sanctions in the late 20th century.5\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Until the mid–20th century, segregated, colonialist societies faced little international opposition: Singapore, Australia, the United States, and many other countries all denied suffrage and other key civil rights to people of non–Caucasian descent without inviting international condemnation. However, with the rise of the civil rights movement and the decolonization movements around the world in the late 50s and early 60s, international norms turned against states that continued to racially segregate their people\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Because of this change in international opinion, Rhodesia and South Africa were both subjected to a U.N. authorized sanction regime from 1965-80 and 1986-93, respectively\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In both cases, the U.N. sanctions were intended to force the two states to abandon their Apartheid policies and grant suffrage to their disenfranchised African majorities\n",
      "\n",
      "1|The sanctions aimed to change the policy, not the regimes; that said, many who were targeted by the sanctions felt that Apartheid was such a crucial aspect of their regime, that granting suffrage to Africans would undermine it.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The outcome of the U.N. sanctions could not have been any more different\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Rhodesian Apartheid, against all odds, survived for 15 years under economic sanctions. Rhodesia accepted power‒sharing with African party members only when the African guerilla fighters made their military situation untenable\n",
      "\n",
      "2|If Rhodesian military situations were more favorable, they may have survived the sanction regime for a lot longer, perhaps even indefinitely. In contrast, South African Apartheid barely lasted eight years, after which it extended suffrage to Africans and released Nelson Mandela from prison\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Because was no military threat to the South African government, the South African decision to end racist policies was primarily an outcome of economic pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|One of the most common determinants of the sanction's effectiveness is the nature of the sanction–targeted state.6 This line of thinking makes sense; the same sanction package may cripple a small nation with little domestic manufacturing capacity to meet internal demand, but barely affect a large nation with the domestic industries to achieve autarky. Likewise, a sanction may be lethal to an export-oriented economy, but a mere annoyance to an economy sustained by domestic consumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Another equally intuitive exercise will examine the breadth and depth of the sanction package.7 The breadth of a sanction package is the proportion of the global market that would participate in the sanction. Obviously, if the United States restricts access to its market, then the sanction would be much more effective than if the United States did not. The depth of a sanction package is the number of commodities sanctioned. In 1983, Australia refused to sell uranium to France; while the sanction did some harm to the French nuclear program, it had little impact on the health of the macroeconomy.8 If Australia had restricted French access to its entire market, the French economy would have been more acutely hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Almost all the key national characteristics of sanctioned Rhodesia and South Africa were astonishingly similar. Both states had a large African majority dominated by a white minority, an Apartheid political system, an isolated diplomatic status, tenuous trade relations, a Southern African geography, an Afrikaan-British heritage, a British colonial history, and an agricultural and mining-based export economy. If any one of these factors were different, it could at least partially explain the sanctions outcome. But with these key national characteristics held largely constant, none of them can explain the drastically different sanctions outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Both Rhodesia and South Africa were placed under comprehensive Hurbauer, Economic Sanctions Reconsidered, 91. economic sanctions with nearly universal participation from all major and most medium powers. For both countries, the sanctions seriously inhibited trade, depreciated their currencies, limited access to international finance, cut off access to foreign aid, and froze foreign assets held by the target government and citizens.9, 10 And yet, the sanctions in Rhodesia and South Africa still produced significantly different political results.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|If similar sanction packages were imposed on similar countries, why did one collapse much more quickly than the other? When neither national context nor sanction package can explain sanction outcomes, the literature turns to micro variables for answers. Consider the following metaphor: if two people with similar phenotypes drank the same amount of milk, why might only one of them suffer indigestion? The doctors would answer that despite the similarities in the general circumstances, there was a miniscule, unclear, but nevertheless very crucial difference between the two individuals, perhaps a slight genetic disposition that makes one lactose intolerant. In a similar fashion, if proponents of sanctions attempted to resolve the Rhodesia-South Africa paradox, they would have answered that despite the similarities between the two sanctions, there must have been micro but very significant differences that contributed to the divergent outcomes. Unfortunately, these micro variables are inconclusive in respect to explaining the South Africa/ Rhodesia case.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|So what could have been a micro difference? One of the most widely known micro variables used to explain divergent sanction outcomes is the vulnerability of a state to economic sanctions relies on the target state's economic concentration: \"the more a country's economy depends on one product, and the more its exports consist of one product… the more vulnerable is the country.\"11 It is also reliant on commodity concentration, or the degree of consumer tastes that are concentrated on one commodity, and geographic concentration, the degree to which the target's trade partners are concentrated on one country. Here again, the implications of this micro foundation are counter-intuitive\n",
      "\n",
      "2|According to a composite vulnerability index that considers these three types of concentration, sanctioned Rhodesia was the fourth most vulnerable state in the world, after Mauritius, Trinidad, and Panama (Galtung, year)12. There is no comparable measure of South Africa's economic vulnerability in 1985, but a comparison of the sum of net export and import, a rough indicator of a given economy's reliance on trade, reveals that Rhodesia was significantly more concentrated than South Africa\n",
      "\n",
      "1|The import-export sum figure for South Africa at the time of the sanction was 22% of GDP,13 while the same figure for Rhodesia was a staggering 66% of GDP.14 These figures indicate that Rhodesia was an exceptionally concentrated, vulnerable state compared to South Africa, and predict the earlier demise of the former.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|With several possible explanations failing to resolve the Rhodesia‒South Africa paradox, many scholars argued whether the sanctions in Rhodesia and South Africa were effective at all in years during and immediately following the sanction.16 Citing the persistent economic rigor of the sanctioned Apartheid states, \"sanction skeptics\" have concluded that sanctions were inconsequential. Their most damning evidence came from Rhodesia. Despite the severe embargo, in 1973, eight years into the sanction, Rhodesia's exports grew, GDP rose by seven percent,17 and domestic manufacturing doubled compared to presanction levels.18 The nation also underwent significant political integration as Rhodesians \"rallied to the flag.\"19 In South Africa, despite significant movement to disinvest, MNCs maintained an indirect presence in the nation.20 Therefore, capital flight and disinvestment from sanctioned South Africa may not have been as economically devastating as the raw economic figures suggest.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The conventional literature fails to explain the Rhodesia-South Africa paradox because it suffers from a consistent over-emphasis of the role of state actors on sanction outcome. Baldwin and many other foundational scholars of the sanctions literature frame economic sanctions tools of \"economic statecraft,\" without mentioning the impact of behaviors by non-state actors on sanctions effectiveness.24 Furthermore, sanction scholars tend to predict the effectiveness of sanctions by relying on macroeconomic or political microfoundations, such as export/import reliance and economic concentration, or regime type and political decision makers, which are all influenced by or a direct outcome of state behaviors.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The reliance of sanctions literature on the behavior of state actors as an explanation follows a general partiality of political science literature to state actors. However, this bias has resulted in an unjustified presumption in recent sanctions literature that the effectiveness of economic sanctions can easily be maximized, and its collateral damage minimized through \"smarter\" sanctions policy with improved political and macroeconomic parameter setting by policy makers. Adherents of \"smarter policy, smarter sanctions\" risk reaching a reductive conclusion that policy makers who are aware of the political/macroeconomic factors affecting sanction effectiveness will produce more effective sanction policies.25 This claim is not empirically supported according to Drezner: despite the frequent implementation of \"smart sanctions,\" sanctions have not become significantly more effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|\"Smarter\" sanctions, however, have not translated into better outcomes. This is because smarter sanctions ultimately suffer from a deficit in the entire economic sanctions literature in general\n",
      "\n",
      "2|All previous scholarship on sanctions are incorrect in assuming that the success or failure of a sanctions policy is largely determined just by the decisions of policy makers and their macroeconomic and political parameter setting. They fail to account for the fact that sanction effectiveness is also determined by the decisions of the MNCs and their microeconomic parameter setting\n",
      "\n",
      "1|If policymakers want to draft a truly \"smart\" sanction, they must not only consider the influence of state behavior on macroeconomic and political parameters, but also the impact of behaviors of non-state actors, namely the MNCs, on sanctions policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|I will construct a model to explain MNC behaviors. Of course, actual MNC decision making is much more involved, but the model has satisfactory explanatory power. In the next section, the model will be used to explain the outcomes of the sanctions placed on Rhodesia and South Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|MNCs are international corporate entities with a single incentive: net profit maximization.26 Assuming MNCs will always choose options that will produce the largest net profit, if MNCs achieve positive net profit from sanctionbusting, they will sanction bust; if not, they will disengage from the sanctioned economy. \"Profit Maximization,\" however, is an aggregate product derived from many incentives and disincentives. Hence, to determine whether a profit-maximizing MNC will sanction-bust or not, the incentives and disincentives that shape the corporate environment must be studied.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The primary incentives and disincentives at work when a profit-maximizing MNC decides to engage with or disengage from a sanctioned economy are future profitability, conspicuity, and max potential punishment. Future Profitability is a positive incentive\n",
      "\n",
      "2|It correlates with the perceived gross economic gain a MNC expects to obtain from engaging in sanction-busting trade. The larger the expected profit from sanctions-busting, the stronger the incentive will be for MNCs to engage with sanctioned economies\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Conversely, the smaller the expected profit, the weaker the incentive to sanction-bust. Conspicuity is a negative disincentive\n",
      "\n",
      "2|It correlates with the expected visibility of the MNC's sanctions-busting operation from the perspective of the sanctioning government and the public at large. High conspicuity significantly discourages MNCs from engaging in sanctionsbusting trade because it is more likely to invite punishment from the sanctioning government and the public\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Max Potential Punishment (or Max Punishment) is a negative disincentive. It correlates with the expected severity of the gravest punitive action conceivable for engaging in sanction busting trade inflicted onto the MNC by the government and the public\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Obviously, the more severe the max potential punishment is, the stronger the disincentive is for MNCs to engage in sanction-busting. In constructing the model, we assume that these three incentive/ disincentives are determined by several key input variables, listed below.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The expected future profitability of a given sanction-busting trade is an output value that is derived from three input variables. One of these inputs is the general economic desirability of the sanctioned economy\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This variable represents the key economic facts, (such as market size or production capacity) that MNCs consider when they decide whether to engage with a market, whether sanctioned or not. Unless the sanctioned economy has some economic value that makes it valuable to the MNCs, they would not trade with them even without sanctions\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The other input variables are relevant only to sanctioned economies. One of these is bargaining power\n",
      "\n",
      "2|MNCs must gauge how much additional bargaining power they have in negotiating with sanctioned economies. These economies are not in a position to take the global market price due to their limited access to the world market, and hence will have to take higher prices for imports and lower prices for exports\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This is to the advantage of MNCs. The greater the bargaining power, the greater the future profitability\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Significant bargaining power permits MNCs to act as a monopolistic price-setter that can undersell the sanctioned economy. The strength of an MNC's bargaining power is determined by the answer to three questions\n",
      "\n",
      "2|(1) Are other MNCs participating in sanction-busting operations? If so, the other players will force the MNC to buy and sell at prices that are more competitive, reducing their bargaining power. (2) To what extent has the sanctioned economy achieved autarky? If the sanctioned economy has achieved a significant degree of autarky and can domestically produce the product supplied by the MNC, then the MNC will have to set prices competitive with domestic products\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Whether autarky is possible or not would at least partly depend on the mobility and the alternative availability of the particular product provided by the MNC. If the product is highly mobile (eg\n",
      "\n",
      "2|a consultant), then the product can be quickly pulled out of a sanctioned economy before there is enough time to establish autarky and produce sanctioned goods domestically. If the product is available from an alternative source, either from other MNCs or a domestic firm, then autarky is much easier\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Lastly, there is (3), the expected duration of the sanction. This is a significant determinant of future profitability\n",
      "\n",

      "2|Conversely, certain private actors with privileged access to insider information of MNC activities, like investigative journalists, may have information that the government does not.

      "2|This would be done by disaggregating conspicuity into the conspicuity of the sanction-busting trade from the sanctioning government, and the conspicuity of the same trade from the public. Unfortunately, disaggregating conspicuity into these two incentives is beyond the scope of this study\n",

      "\n",
      "2|If the sanction-busting activity is technically legal, it could come in the form of closing of loopholes, severance of government contract to MNCs, and other extra-judicial punitive measures.

      "1|While it may seem wise to disaggregate public punishment and government punishment, this is not necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|MNCs anticipate their actual punishment for engaging in sanction-busting trade to be much smaller than, and rarely equal to, the Max Punishment threatened. Such optimism is not exclusive to MNC\n",
      "\n",
      "2|It is not uncommon for criminal entities to perceive the expected punishment as much lower than what is threatened. For example, students perceive the actual punishment of smoking marijuana to be much less serious than the Max Punishment because they are confident they won't be caught\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This expectation as to what extent the Max Punishment will be realized is entirely dependent on conspicuity. Similarly, the students in the previous example will expect more serious consequences if, instead of smoking at home, they smoke in front of the police\n",

      "1|Likewise, MNCs perceive that higher degrees of conspicuity makes it more likely for the government and the public to impose the Maximum Punishment, and less conspicuity makes such punishment less likely.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|The sanctioner government is more likely to retaliate against a conspicuous sanctions-breaking operation for two reasons. First, if the MNC's sanctions-busting operation is illegal, government agencies are more likely to uncover and punish conspicuous sanctions-busting trade. Second, even if the MNC's operation is still technically legal due to loopholes, the governments are still more likely to interpret conspicuous sanctions-busting activities as an affront to government authority.The governments will have strong incentives to either amend the sanction legislation, close the loophole, or even resort to extrajudicial measures to punish the \"legal\" trade. While a government might look the other way if an illegal transaction is done under the table, it may be forced to take retaliatory measures if the same trade is done in broad daylight, in open defiance to the authority of the state.27\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The public is more likely to retaliate against conspicuous sanctionbusting operations because the principal method of retaliation used by the public against MNC, boycotting, requires widespread mobilization.28 Boycotting is a worthwhile weapon only if enough people participate. However, people would consider a boycott only if they are aware of the MNC's sanction-busting operations. The public is more likely to be aware of MNC operations that are visible; thus, a conspicuous sanction-busting trade is necessary to activate civil society in an effective retaliatory boycott.\n",

      "2|Now that all the inputs behind each of the incentive and disincentives have been described, it's time to present the way in which the incentive/disincentives of future profitability, conspicuity, and max punishment produce the final MNC decision. The corporate calculus is:\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The economic benefit of sanction busting is abstracted as P. Hence, a larger P correlates with a larger D, as higher the future profitability of a trade, the greater the incentive for MNCs to sanction bust\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Future profitability only accounts for the gross future profitability of sanction-busting. However, sanction busting comes with its own expected cost that will depress net profits\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This expected political and social cost of sanction busting is modeled by C*(MP). A larger MP correlates with a smaller D, as the more severe the maximum potential punishment is for sanctionbusting, the more MNCs are discouraged from engaging in such operations\n",
      "\n",
      "2|However, the severity of the punishment imparts any meaningful weight on the MNC decision making only if sanction-busting trade is conspicuous enough for the government and the public to inflict all, or part of, the maximum possible punishment onto the MNC. In other words, no matter how severe the potential punishment is for sanction-busting, MNCs will only be discouraged if sanctionbusting is flagrant enough to invite punishment\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Thus, the extent to which the max potential punishment disincentivizes sanction-busting depends on conspicuity, a variable which ranges from 0 to 1 in this model. If Conspicuity is 0, the sanctionbusting transaction is invisible and hence the MNC decision making is unaffected by the empty threat of punishment\n",
      "\n",
      "1|If Conspicuity is 1, sanction-busting is visible and the MNC expects the full weight of the threatened punishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Maximum Possible Punishment from the public, and Maximum Possible Punishment from the sanctioner government were integrated into one incentive function.

      "4|Now that the incentive/disincentive model for MNCs has been established, let us apply it to South Africa and Rhodesia. In each case study, I will first establish that the decisions of MNCs to engage or disengage, Rhodesia for the former and South Africa for the latter, weakened the state's economic health and its capacity to reject the sanctioner demand to end apartheid. This shows that MNC decision did affect the outcome of the sanction. Second, I will trace the decision-making process of key MNCs where I find the measure of the input variables, derive the incentive/disincentive from the inputs and add the incentive/ disincentive to derive the final decision of the MNCs and its impact on the sanctioned economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Faced with the prospects of an imminent sanction, many key MNCs chose to disengage from the South African economy rather than participate in sanction-busting trade. Their decisions destroyed the South African economy\n",

      "2|The most visible damage to the South African economy came from capital flight. Foreign capital fled Praetoria for safer investment options,29 leading to higher South African interest rates\n",

      "\n",
      "2|Less visible in the short term but just as corrosive in the long term was the withdrawal of FDI by MNC from the sanctioned state. Two hundred MNCs with FDIs in South Africa chose to disinvest32, selling off their physical assets to South Africans\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Because of disinvestment, about 5 billion Rand of FDI was lost.33\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Disinvestment harmed South African industries in two ways. First, it cut off local production facilities, previously owned by MNC subsidiaries, from the MNC's global supply and distribution network, leading to drastic reduction in corporate profits, wage, and unemployment. Second, because of disinvestment, the South African economy lost the practical and technical knowhow of the MNCs that was now integral to maintain South African competitiveness. The MNC decision to disinvest reduced South African access to global supply/distribution chains and MNC knowhow, which in turn paralyzed productivity growth from 1985 to 1993.34 This stagnation was caused by the sanction, as the economy recovered its high productivity growth after the sanction was lifted.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The combined impact of capital flight and disinvestment intensified the economic crisis. When capital fled, international interest rates rose, and foreign exchange became scarce, the South African economy required a competitive export market to acquire foreign currency if it was to have any chance of staying afloat\n",
      "\n",
      "2|However, disinvestment reduced South African productivity, hamstringing international competitiveness and reducing its ability to earn foreign currency. The negative spiral was reflected in the meager GDP growth rate during the sanction\n",
      "\n",
      "2|During the duration of the sanction from 1985 to 1993, GDP stagnated, growing only by 20 billion. In comparison, the South African economy grew 60 billion from 1975 to 1985, and 130 billion from 1995 to 2005.35\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The economic downturn caused by MNC decisions created political pressure to end the sanction as median voters, most of whom suffered financially, steered the political tone of the government to one of reconciliation.36 The most apparent impact felt by the average South African came in the form of more expensive imports. Import prices inflated due to the depreciation of the Rand caused by capital flight\n",
      "\n",
      "2|As a result, the South Africans were forced abstain from luxury, sometimes necessities, that were imported. The South African current account surplus grew in this period despite weaker exports, because reduced imports more than offset declines in import (South African Reserve Bank)37\n",
      "\n",
      "2|As Rodman notes, the South African economy was not in a state of total collapse. However, for a people used to easy credits and no shortage of goods, the MNC's disengagement undermined the economic security that until then they had taken for granted\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This created an imperative for policy change. The disinvestment of many famous MNCs also created a psychological imperative amongst decision makers to change direction\n",
      "\n",
      "1|The simultaneous rejection of South African apartheid by private actors through disinvestment and by public actors through withholding of diplomatic recognition reinforced the perceived isolation of South Africa and undermined the legitimacy of Apartheid.38\n",
      "\n",
      "4|One caveat to this narrative is that, since white-only suffrage excluded black and colored Africans from voting, the \"median voter\" of Apartheid South Africa was by no means synonymous with the \"median citizen.\" In fact, the \"median voter,\" who was most likely white and affluent, and the \"median citizen,\" who was most likely black and poor, had different experiences in sanctioned South Africa. As in other historical examples of sanctioning, the population that the sanction was supposed to help suffered the brunt of the economic devastation; \"the median citizen\"– the many Africans under Apartheid – experienced even more drastic economic collapse under the sanction regime than did white voters.39 For instance, in companies formerly operated by MNCs before disinvestment, internal corporate regulations that barred discriminatory practices were repealed once each MNC administration was replaced by domestic management. The change in administration exposed the African employees of these companies to even greater discrimination and economic damage.40 Given the severe, short-term economic devastation experienced by Africans, which dwarfed the inconveniences suffered by white voters, if the Africans did have electoral power, there would probably have been an even greater political pressure to end apartheid. If the \"median voter\" did include Africans, Apartheid may have collapsed even sooner under sanctions; but again, there would be no Apartheid if Africans had the vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|MNCs decided to disengage from South Africa because continued engagement with South Africa would have entailed low future profitability, high conspicuity, and high Max Punishment. There was a weak positive economic incentive and a strong negative political and social disincentive to sanction-bust, leading to a decision to disengage. The disincentive from political and social sanctions exceeded incentives from the expected profit MNCs could gain by sustained engagement. As these incentives/disincentives are derived from several input factors, I will examine each of these inputs to determine how MNCs establish their incentives/disincentives.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|MNCs expected low future profitability from sanction-busting in South Africa due to expectations of low economic desirability of trading with South Africa, weak bargaining power in sanction-busting negotiation, and a long period of sanction. First, the South African economy was not a very desirable market for MNCs\n",
      "\n",
      "2|For MNCs with FDI assets in South Africa, the revenue collected from operations in South Africa often amounted only to about two percent of total revenue, and thus was not essential for overall company future profitability.41 For international banks, historically South Africa's primary value had been a stable African investment option with higher interest rates than in the developed world. However, after MNCs with FDI assets retreated, destabilizing the economy in the process, the primary merit of South African investment – its stability – eroded, making South Africa a less desirable investment option\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Second, the MNCs expected weak bargaining power from negotiation, so they were skeptical they could maintain competitive prices or profits because the MNCs would have to compete with competitive prices from budding but growing domestic manufacturers. In addition, numerous MNCs were engaged with pre-sanction South Africa; hence, in the \"fog of war\" where MNCs (like all market actors) are unaware of the decisions of their competitors, an MNC could not rule out the possibility that some of their competitors may also decide to sanction-bust, reducing their own bargaining power in undercutting South African prices\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Finally, with the historical knowledge that the only other example of a comprehensive, U.N.-led sanction against another Apartheid African state, Rhodesia, was a protracted affair lasting 15 years despite early expectation that it would be over within the year, it would be expected that most MNCs probably anticipated the sanction against South Africa to be a long-term affair. Expectations for a longterm sanction reduced the need to maintain trade contact with South Africa in case commercial relations were normalized again soon\n",
      "\n",
      "1|These input factors totaled to a weak, positive future profitability incentive to sanction-bust.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|MNCs perceived that any sanction-busting activity would be conspicuous and subject to a serious maximum potential punishment. This expectation was more a result of heightened public awareness than of government authority\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Even before the sanctions were formally instated, several NGOs had dedicated themselves to exposing MNCs with engagements in South Africa. In the early 1960s, a decade before the mandatory U.N\n",
      "\n",
      "2|sanctions were authorized, the Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM) organized civilian boycotts of South African goods by naming and shaming companies engaged with South Africa.42The AAM fizzled out in the late 1960s, but other NGOs continued the fight. Several campus student organizations petitioned their universities to disinvest from MNCs engaged in trade with South Africa, often naming specific corporations that the universities were invested in.43 Because of this activism by an activated civil society, MNCs expected high visibility of sanction-busting operations in South Africa\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This is not to say that the local black South Africans exercised little agency in combatting the Apartheid regime ruling over them. If anything, the civilian boycott in the West gained critical mass only after the world witnessed the intense resistance of black South Africans to the institution of the South African Constitution of 1983, which reaffirmed racial segregation.44 That said, external actors (inspired to action by the resistance of black South African internal actors) played the predominant role in shaping MNC behaviors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|NGOs also had a deep well of support they could readily mobilize for boycotts and public campaigns, raising the maximum punishment that the public could inflict upon MNCs. In 1971, the U.S.-based Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR) pressured corporations operating in South Africa to adopt the Sullivan principles – a seven-point program that demanded non-segregated workplaces and \"equal and fair opportunities for all employees\" regardless of race.45 Since it was illegal under South African law to abide by the Sullivan principles, the ICCR pressured companies to leave South Africa\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Those that did not leave South Africa faced massive consumer and investor boycotts organized by the ICCR. Furthermore, the widespread student protests meant that 155 university institutions had disinvested from MNCs trading with South Africans by 1988\n",
      "\n",
      "2|As such, NGOs saw that they would receive a severe punishment in the form of disinvestment by universities, who are key institutional investors, if they continued to sanctionbust.46 The NGOs also significantly raised the maximum punishment that the sanctioner government could impose.by pressuring municipal, local, and state governments to rescind lucrative government contracts with MNCs engaged with South Africa. Combined, these conditions created the threat of high maximum potential punishment by both the public and the government\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Furthermore, because of the visibility of sanction-busting operations, the MNCs expected the full extent of the maximum punishment if they did engage with South Africa. As a result, a powerful negative disincentive, fueled by high conspicuity and high maximum punishment, overrode the weak positive incentive and led to the MNC decision to disengage.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Although MNCs were pervasive in the Rhodesian economy, they still had an indispensable role in the Rhodesian economy that was equally important, if asymmetrical, to their functions in the South African economy because they provided all the Rhodesian energy requirement. Lacking any domestic energy sources, namely oil, Rhodesia was 100% dependent on oil imports, all of which were provided by oil giant MNCs.47 Rhodesia's dependency on oil MNCs was exacerbated by its landlocked geography, which forced the country to rely on pipelines to transport oil from the South East African coast, all of which were owned by the MNCs.48\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The mediumto long-term decision of oil giant MNCs to stay engaged in Rhodesia was crucial to the country's economic health. Numerous commentators of the time noted that Rhodesia's economy would have collapsed very quickly without its oil imports.49 The continued oil imports permitted the rapid industrial expansion that was crucial for Rhodesia to skirt the worst effects of the sanction\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Such an industrial expansion helped in two ways. First, an intensive import substitution industrialization program supplied Rhodesia with goods no longer imported under the sanction.50 Second, the domestic manufacturing expansion compensated for the economic atrophy of the former cash cows of Rhodesia under the sanction, such as the tobacco industry.51 The macroeconomic health of the country was maintained by shifting the source of growth away from such atrophied industries hit by the sanction to domestic manufacturing that supplied internal consumption\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This industrial expansion was possible only through the continued supply of oil by MNCs. So, without oil imports, there would have been no industrial expansion, and the Rhodesian economy would have collapsed quickly due to shortage of imported goods and the collapse of source of income industries without another growth source to replace it.52 In addition to the industrial expansion, the ready availability of oil from MNCs softened the upward price pressure of oil per gallon\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Cheaper oil was essential to Rhodesia, which was suffering from a foreign currency shortage, as expensive oil would have quickly depleted Rhodesian foreign currency reserves. 53\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Rhodesia's ability to resist demands to abandon Apartheid was directly tied to the economic ramifications of the MNCs' continued engagement. The expansion of domestic manufacturing permitted by the oil import provided workers in sectors weakened by the sanction with alternative employment.54 Furthermore, the growing domestic manufacturing industry – and the economic health of the economy it helped maintain – also bolstered civilian morale\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Secondly, Rhodesia could spend its foreign exchange on other vital economic concerns, as it did not need to pay a premium for smuggled oil. For example, without surplus cheap credit, Rhodesian agricultural subsidies for sanctioned tobacco goods would have quickly become unsustainable\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The same foreign currency was also crucial to acquire weaponries needed to fight the guerilla war against Black nationalists.55 Finally, the abundance of oil meant the life of the median Rhodesian voter was largely unaffected. Rhodesians could still drive cars, as long as they carpooled every so often\n",
      "\n",
      "1|If anything, what little oil rationing there was inspired a \"rally-to-the-flag\" effect on national unity that far outweighed the negative impact of the minor inconvenience.56 However, if oil shortages and the drop in white living standards were far more severe, Rhodesians could be expected to have behaved differently, perhaps demanding that the government cave to sanction demands.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Although the MNC decision in the mediumto long-term was to sanction-bust in Rhodesia, this was not initially the case. At the very beginning of the sanction, incentives/disincentives motivated oil giant MNCs to disengage from the sanctioned economy\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The oil giant MNCs initially cooperated with the British government, the primary sanctioner government, and agreed to stop oil shipments to Rhodesia.

      "\n",
      "2|However, overtime, these incentives/ disincentives changed, until they settled in a pattern of low future profitability, low conspicuity, and low Maximum Punishment. The new constellation of incentives/disincentives then encouraged MNCs to change their decisions from disengagement to engagement as although the low future profitability meant there was only a weak incentive, the low conspicuity and maximum punishment meant the negative disincentive to sanction-bust was even more marginal\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Tracing MNC behaviors in Rhodesia in terms of the incentive/ disincentive model highlights that when incentives/disincentives change over time, MNC decisions will shift with the incentives.\n",

      "2|At the beginning of the sanction, the constellation of key input variables meant oil giant MNCs expected moderate future profitability from the sanction. Given how small the Rhodesian demand for oil was, the Rhodesian market had limited economic desirability\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The MNCs also expected medium bargaining power. The Rhodesians had no domestic oil industries to compete with which the MNCs, giving MNCs monopolistic control over price controls\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Furthermore, since there were only five oil giant MNCs operating in Rhodesia, the withdrawal of any one competitor would significantly lower competitive pressure. In light of the optimistic statements about the quick capitulation of the Apartheid regime by the government and the public, the MNCs did not expect sanctions to last long\n",
      "\n",
      "1|In total, the input variables of low general economic desirability, medium bargaining power, and short expected duration of sanction, resulted in the MNC expectation of moderate future profitability from sanction-busting.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|However, as the sanction progressed, the future profitability incentive begun to change. The sanction, which everyone claimed would be over very quickly, dragged on for years\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Hence, the MNCs now expected a sanction with a longer duration. With lower expectation that trade relations would be normalized anytime soon, the MNCs felt less compelled to maintain trade contact\n",
      "\n",
      "1|This change in this input meant its output, the future profitability incentive, changed: now, there was a weak future profitability incentive to continue trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|At the beginning of the sanction, the MNCs expected high conspicuity from engaging in sanction-busting because they expected visibility from the sanctioner government of United Kingdom. The British government declared that the British navy would enforce the sanction by identifying any ships carrying oil to ports that were conventionally used to transport oil to Rhodesia.57 Once the ships were identified, they could easily be tracked to their patron oil giant MNC; hence, the high conspicuity of MNC sanction busting.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|When Joanne V, an oil tanker, defied the British blockade and sailed into Beira, a Mozambique port used to transport oil to Rhodesia, the British government – sanctioned by a U.N. resolution to use force if necessary to stop the oil trade – declared that any ships that unloaded oil destined to Rhodesia would be seized.58 The threat was taken seriously by MNCs: Joanne V left the Mozambique port without unloading its oil.59 Attempts by MNCs to break the blockade by using an oil pipeline of significant symbolic value as the connection between Rhodesia and South Africa were also shut down by the British government. Most MNCs saw the highly conspicuous, punishable nature of trading with Rhodesia to be a disincentive that far outweighed the paltry future profitability incentive and disengaged from Rhodesia.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|However, as time went on, the MNCs increasingly perceived low conspicuity since South African state practices changed the incentive structure. MNCs could deliver oil anonymously to Rhodesia as South Africa offered to purchase oil from MNCs and then sell it to Rhodesia. This permitted MNCs to claim plausible deniability – how could MNCs \"know,\" and so take responsibility for, what the South Africans were going to do with the oil once it was sold? In addition, the public attention to the sanction-busting operations was diverted from the sanction-busting MNCs to the South African regime that permitted it; thus, the increased South African notoriety caused reduced MNC conspicuity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|As for maximum punishment, South African state practice again changed the incentive structure. By threatening to impose a mutually painful countersanction onto the British economy, the South African regime prohibited the British from blockading a few Mozambique ports that were used to supply oil to both Rhodesia and South Africa\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The official reason given for this prohibition by the South African government was that a blockade of the Mozambique ports would threaten South African access to oil. As a result, cargo ships transporting oil to these ports, whether with South African or Rhodesian contracts, were immune to British reprisals\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Under the pretext of \"protecting national interest in protecting South African access to oil,\" the South Africans protected the Rhodesian oil trade. The MNCs saw that the British were spooked by the South African protests and, unwilling to risk a potential South African countersanction, would not enforce a comprehensive blockade of all ports.60 Because of South African state practice, the incentive structure changed, and given low future profitability, low conspicuity, and marginal maximum punishment, MNCs changed their commercial orientations and sanction-busted on behalf of Rhodesia for the rest of the sanction duration.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|\"Low\" implies negligible amounts that only marginally tips the balance of the equation. \"Moderate\" implies a considerable amount that can affect MNC decision-making unless it is overdetermined by a \"high\" value, which has the potential of single handedly determining the outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The behaviors of MNC operating under sanctioned regimes offer insights into what make sanctions effective. Truly effective sanctions must consider the corporate calculus of MNCs, and shape the incentive/ disincentives driving corporate behavior to one of compliance with the law\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The most important implication of the incentive/disincentive model is that makers of sanction policy should not only focus on threatening the MNCs, but also increasing their conspicuity in sanction-busting operations. Policymakers should prioritize raising the conspicuity of sanction-busting activities just as much as designing punishments for misbehavior; after all, the most severe punishments are paper tigers unless they are enforceable, and punishments are enforceable if and only if they can be detected in the first place\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Furthermore, policymakers must be aware that, as observed in Rhodesia, third-party states can easily manipulate the MNC incentive structure to promote sanction-busting. South African intervention in the sanction structure for Rhodesia ultimately shaped MNC behavior in a way that limits sanction effectiveness\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Policymakers must plan for another \"South Africa\" contingency by preparing to counter such attempts by third party states to undermine sanction effectiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|There are a few caveats to this model. First, the increased public awareness of MNC sanction-busting was assumed to encourage the public to enforce punishments\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This may not necessarily the case if the public is indifferent to, or perhaps even hostile to, the government's sanction policy. If the public does not perceive the MNC sanction-busting as deplorable, they will not be motivated to punish the MNC for it\n",

      "4|There is yet to be a method of determining – beyond qualitative terms – the amount of clout MNCs have in a sanctioned economy. In South Africa, the sheer number of MNCs implied heavy MNC clout, but clout does not necessarily require numbers. In Rhodesia, while fewer MNCs were operating, the MNC oil monopoly in the Rhodesian market made them punch far above their weight in terms of importance to the national economy. The more MNCs control crucial resources, the more impact they have on the national economy.\n",

      "4|In this model, a linear relationship was assumed between conspicuity and the actual punishment sustained by the corporations. This may not necessarily be the case. The government and the public may tolerate MNC misdemeanors to a point and only retaliate if the MNCs overstep a critical line. Future research should clarify whether the relationship between conspicuity and actual punishment is actually linear or, if fact, incremental, where actual punishment remains unchanged for increasing conspicuity until a point, at which the actual punishment shoots up.\n",

      "2|Despite the several rounds of severe sanctions imposed on the hermit kingdom to persuade it to abandon its nuclear program, the North Koreans continue to survive, buoyed by sanction-busting Russian and Chinese firms61. Realistically, there is little the international community can do through economic coercion to convince the powerful, autarkic Chinese and Russian states to refrain from supporting sanction-busting firms\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Perhaps, however, the Chinese and Russian firms themselves can be convinced of the errors of their ways by manipulating their incentive structures. Thankfully, the policymakers seem to have realized this earlier than academics\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The U.S. treasury has imposed rounds of secondary sanctions not on states trading with the North Koreans, but on individual sanction-busting firms.62 These firms are now barred from interacting with U.S.-based firms, putting them at major competitive disadvantage\n",

      "2|These secondary sanctions were installed only recently at the time this article was written, so it is too early to evaluate how effective they are, and anyhow they are beyond the scope of this paper. While it is encouraging that policymakers are turning towards non-state centric solutions, further research should apply the incentive/disincentive model to explain whether Russian and Chinese firms were actually dissuaded from sanction-busting.\n",

      "2|In this essay, I analyze the impacts of such scandals and Rousseff's impeachment on the Brazilian economy.

Much earlier than that, in 1964, sixteen-year-old Rousseff served as a militant for the VAR-Palmares, an armed revolutionary organization that fought against the military dictatorship in Brazil\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This organization, influenced by Debray's Revolution in the Revolution and Fidel Castro's success in Cuba, found an answer for Brazil in Marxism. However, in a repressive far-right military regime, VAR-Palmares lacked political rights\n",

      "\n",
      "2|Through the PDT, Rousseff was elected Porto Alegre's Municipal Finance Secretary between 1985 and 1988. In 1989, she became director general of Porto Alegre's City Council under the administration of Alceu Collares\n",
      "\n",
      "1|In 1991, Collares appointed Rousseff as the president of the Foundation of Economics and Statistics, where she served until being elected the state's Secretary of Energy, Mines and Communications in 1993 (Amaral, 2011).\n",

      "2|A few years later, Rousseff's trajectory with the Worker's Party (PT) would begin. In 1998, she helped PT-candidate for state governor Olivio Dutra to win an election in Rio Grande do Sul\n",
      "\n",
      "2|By then, Rousseff's de facto affiliation had turned from the PDT to the PT – a fact confirmed later that year when she left PDT after the party decided to break with the PT. In 2001, Dilma's preference for the Worker's Party went viral\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In 2003, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva appointed Rousseff as his Minister of Mining and Energy (Amaral, 2011). In the same year, Rousseff became the President of the Board of the Directors of Brazil's largest oil and state-owned enterprise (SOE), Petrobras\n",

      "2|Two years after being nominated Minister of Mining and Energy, Rousseff had proven to be a firm, competent politician who could handle Brasilia quite well. Lula, impressed by her skills and desperate to find a replacement for his Chief of Staff Jose Dirceu, who was caught in the mensalão, the largest corruption scandal of Brazilian political history until then, fell on her\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In Rousseff, he found a friend and the fuel needed to reset Brasilia's engine. In 2005, Lula appointed Dilma as his newest Chief of Staff\n",
      "\n",
      "2|He trusted her not only to manage Brazil's ministries, but also two of his administration's major programs. The first, \"Minha Casa, Minha Vida,\" (my house, my life) promoted affordable housing for those living in poverty in Brazil\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The second, \"Programa de Aceleração de Crescimento\" (growth acceleration program, also known as PAC), provided an economic stimulus package with investment projects in Brazil. This program was particularly responsible for increasing Rousseff's reputation, as Lula proudly entitled her the \"mother of the PAC\" (Amaral, 2011).\n",
      "\n",
      "2|As Chief of Staff, \"mother of the PAC,\" and Lula's protégé, Rousseff became the Worker's Party strongest candidate for the 2010 elections. Running her campaign on the motto \"for Brazil to keep changing,\" Rousseff won the runoff with 56.95% of the votes (Savarese and Bencke, 2016).\n",

In the end of 2009, The Economist cover announced \"Brazil Takes Off\" (The Economist, 2009). In 2010, Peter Hakim published his book entitled \"Brazil on the Rise\" (Hakim, 2010) and Forbes released an article suggesting \"Brazil's Economy Catches Its Breath\" (Delgado, 2010).

      "2|These, among other publications, reflected the projections created for Brazil's economic path: a path to be of success, development, growth, power, independence, and global influence. The first years of Rousseff's administration were filled with momentum to see Brazil step into the role of global leader\n",
      "\n",
      "2|However, the end of 2013 served as presage to a large group of politicians, including Lula and Rousseff, that the years to come would not be so glorious.

Initiated in 2009, the Car Wash Operation, named after a network of gas stations and car washes that to managed illicit resources pertaining to a criminal organization in Brazil, investigated a Federal Deputy from the state of Paraná, accused of money laundering (MPF, 2016)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The MP also investigated Alberto Youssef, a black market dollar dealer who was already familiar to the Federal Police. In 2013, telephone interceptions monitored conversations among several dollar dealers in order to obtain further information on the criminal organizations charged with money laundering (MPF, 2016)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In July of that year, the Police learned about Youssef's car donation to a former Director of Petrobras, Paulo Roberto Costa (MPF, 2016). This discovery led the Police to suspect that these criminal organizations' network for money laundering was larger than ever thought\n",
      "\n",
      "1|The investigations did not only involve politicians who had previously been involved in this kind of corruption scandals, but they also involved businessmen and contractor companies across the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|As the Federal Police, along with the Public Prosecutor's Office, denounced the dimension and severity of the Car Wash Operation, the economy reacted in despair. The first phase of the Car Wash investigations happened in March 2014\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In this phase, the Police along with the MP arrested 17 people, including dollar dealer Alberto Youssef and former Director of Petrobras, Paulo Roberto da Costa (MPF, 2016). Since then, political and economic turmoil arose in Brazil as the Operation would discover more people involved every single day\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In April 2014, the scandal had escalated so deeply that a Parliamentary Inquiry Commission (CPI) on Petrobras was installed in the Senate to address issues pertaining solely to the corruption revealed in the Car Wash Operation (G1, 2016). In June, already in its fourth phase, the investigations revealed that most of the money laundered had been deposited into bank accounts in fiscal havens, such as Monaco and Switzerland\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Among the owners of these accounts was Paulo Roberto da Costa (Borges, 2016). When invited to testify about the issue, nonetheless, Costa became known as a whistleblower\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Speaking under a plea bargain, Costa explained how the laundering schemes worked. In addition, as he denounced major players in these schemes, he cited the involvement of President Dilma Rousseff (Borges, 2016; MPF, 2016)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|By September 2014, the Car Wash Operation confirmed that part of the money laundering was illegally used to fund 2010 political campaigns from major parties, including Rousseff's PT and VP Michel Temer's PMDB (Borges, 2016). By the end of the year, the Operation had reached the seventh phase, arrested 39 people, and investigated four major Brazilian contractor companies: OAS, Odebrecht, Camargo Correa, and Queiroz Galvão (Borges, 2016).\n",

      "\n",
      "2|Mistrusting the Worker's Party administration, Brazilians feared that the 6.8 percent unemployment rate would skyrocket (Borges, 2016). In addition, as the dollar continued to quickly appreciate, they feared that the bust after the boom had arrived\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The same media outlets that had partaken in Brazil's exhilaration around 2010 now expressed their woes. The Economist published \"Why Brazil Needs Change\" (The Economist, 2014) followed by \"Brazil In a Quagmire\" (The Economist, 2015)\n",

      "2|Despite the Car Wash Operation and the frustration brought with it, the corruption scandal did not compromise the Worker's Party leadership.

      "\n",
      "2|Even though the Car Wash Operation did not compromise the Worker's Party ability to re-elect Rousseff as President in 2014, the scandal and the economic despair dominating Brazil at the time alarmed Brasilia that instability was on the rise. Early in January 2015, then President of Petrobras, Graça Foster, suggested that the company had lost R$ 88,6 billion due to the Car Wash Scandal (G1, 2015)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In February, a former manager of operations of Petrobras revealed that the Worker's Party had received somewhere between US$ 150 to US$ 200 million in one bribery contract (MPF, 2016). A few months later, as the investigation reached its twelfth phase, Folha de São Paulo, a renowned newspaper in Brazil, published an interview with Ricardo Pessoa, a contractor CEO who claimed that his company had donated R$ 7.5 million to Dilma Rousseff's reelection campaign (MPF, 2016).\n",
      "\n",
      "2|A famous saying in Brazil says that those who search for something, will eventually find it. This proverb was reiterated throughout all of the MP's investigations in 2015\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The more the Car Wash Operation searched for corruption schemes, the more names it found and the more complex the network of money laundering actors was revealed to be. In 2015 alone, the investigation had fourteen phases, arresting more than forty people, condemning more than twelve, and recovering more than R$870 million (G1, 2016)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Through these operations, the presidents of contractor companies such as Odebrecht were arrested. Politicians such as former Presidents of Brazil Fernando Collor and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, then-Presidents of the House and of the Senate, Eduardo Cunha and Renan Calheiros, respectively, and former Chief of Staff José Dirceu were denounced for being involved in major money laundering schemes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|If anything, 2015 was the year that shook Brasilia. Brazil's political \"crème de la crème\" was shaken\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Most parties were involved; every politician was pointing fingers. The German newspaper Die Zeit compared the political intrigues in Brazil to those in House of Cards (Fischermann, 2016)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In addition to the political turmoil, economic instability also emerged. Economic indicators demonstrated that the economy had contracted by 3.8 per cent in 2015, while inflation had escalated to 10.67 per cent (see figures 3 and 4)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The Brazilian Real had been severely depreciated as the exchange rate against the US dollar appreciated to 3.95943 (see appendix, Fig. I)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Unemployment reached 9 per cent, the highest level in the last four years (see figure 5). Likewise, the federal debt also broke the administration's record reaching almost R$ 2 trillion (see appendix, Fig\n",
      "\n",
      "2|III). In tandem, the political and economic instability that dominated Brazil in 2015 set the tone for drastic changes in the year to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The economic and political instability present in Rousseff's second term extended to 2016 as well – so much so that her presidency was compromised. The Car Wash Operations continued to investigate major networks of politicians and contractor companies involved with Petrobras and its money laundering schemes\n",
      "\n",
      "2|By the time this paper was written, The Public Prosecutor's Office, along with the Federal Police, has established 1,397 procedures, conveyed 654 searches and seizures, 77 preventive arrests, 92 temporary arrests, and 6 in flagrante delicto. The Operation has received 52 criminal charges against 254 people for crimes of corruption, drug-trafficking, formation of criminal organization, and money laundering (MPF, 2016)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|These crimes refer to briberies that sum up to approximately R$ 6.4 billion, of which R$3.1 billion are to be recovered. Up to December 2016, the Car Wash Operation has condemned 118 people, accounting for more than 1,256 years of prison in total (MPF, 2016).\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Different from the previous two years, nonetheless, the findings on the Petrolão compromised the Worker's Party administration like never before. As major members of the Party were arrested and indicted of money laundering crimes, Brazilians grew disillusioned with their political leadership\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Just like in June 2013, the population returned to the streets demanding Rousseff to leave her office. Economic mismanagement caused inflation to increase to 10.7 per cent, and unemployment to reach 11 per cent\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Tired of corruption and frustrated with the lack of investments in the country, people demanded change.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In May 2016, the Senate opened the process of impeachment against Rousseff. According to jurists Janaina Paschoal, Hélio Bicudo, and Miguel Reale Jr., Rousseff had violated the Fiscal Responsibility Law (G1, 2016)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|They claimed she had authorized R$2.5 billion of additional expenses between July and August 2015. According to the Law, such authorization could not have happened since government expenditures did not match the fiscal goals for the year, especially since the administration was committed to increase its savings to pay the public debt (G1, 2016)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Rousseff was also charged for borrowing money from other federal institutions such as the Central Bank and the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) to finance her government's social programs in 2015, as cash transfer Bolsa Familia and Plano Safra (G1, 2016). This is known as a \"fiscal pedal\" in Brazil, as the government seeks to disguise a breakdown in the public accounts\n",
      "\n",
      "1|However, as the judges highlighted, \"fiscal pedals\" infringe the Fiscal Responsibility Law, which forbids the government from borrowing money from public banks that are under the Executive branch (G1, 2016).\n",
      "\n",
      "2|With Rousseff temporarily removed from office for three months, Rousseff's VP, Michel Temer, was put in charge of the interim presidency. Forbes reported that for the first time since 2009, Brazil's current account went into surplus\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The market reacted positively with an appreciation of the Brazilian Real (Rapoza, 2016). As Temer appointed his cabinet, he carefully selected conservative technocrats who would take Brazil to a route much different from that during the PT years\n",
      "\n",
      "1|So much so that into two weeks after Dilma's temporary leave, Temer's Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles already proposed cuts of more than 2 per cent of the GDP (Rapoza, 2016).\n",
      "\n",
      "2|During the interim months, political instability was followed by acute polarization. On one side, scholars, mainstream civilians, politicians, and the press would argue that it was time for Dilma and her crew to go (The Economist, 2016)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|On the other side, people would argue that Rousseff's impeachment was a political coup orchestrated by the Brazil's Rightist elite. Despite disagreements, the Senate voted 61 to 20 to impeach Rousseff, convicting her of infringing the Fiscal Responsibility Law\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Then-interim head of state, Mr. Michel Temer took over Brasilia, where he will preside until 2018 (Romero, 2016).\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Measuring the economic impacts of the Car Wash Operations as well as Rousseff's impeachment is not an easy task. An anonymous officer at the Brazilian Embassy in Washington DC suggested that the consequences brought by the economic and political instability in Brazil could by no means be quantified\n",
      "\n",
      "2|For her, \"the corruption scandal in Brazil removed the cork from the bottle. It served to shine light on larger structural obstacles that the country already faced both economically and politically.\" While I agree with the officer's argument that Brazil's de facto struggle refers to structural issues rather than corruption alone, I disagree that the economic impacts of the Car Wash Operation, as well as the impeachment, cannot be quantified\n",
      "\n",
      "1|In this section, I will address the economic indicators that I personally monitored at the Embassy of Brazil, as well as some scholarly arguments, as an endeavor to measure the impact of both events on the Brazilian economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The Car Wash Operation contributed to the economic and political instability present in Brazil, but it was not the protagonist factor. The Operation, with the help of the press, was able to reveal the expansive network of corrupted politicians across Brazil\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Such revelation did not give room for people's political complacency. For the first time, a corruption scandal compromised political parties and their members\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In this way, the corruption scandal contributed to the political instability in the country. In addition, the scandal also played a role impacting the economic instability in Brazil\n",
      "\n",
      "2|As corruption schemes and political instability were revealed to the public, investments decreased severely. Compromising Brazil's credibility, the Car Wash Operation and the impeachment spillovers detracted foreign investment\n",
      "\n",
      "2|As Figure 1 shows, from 2014 to 2016, FDI decreased by almost US$20 billion. Moreover, domestic investments also decreased\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The continuous increase in the interest rate has prevented investors from borrowing money (see appendix, fig. IV), and the involvement of major contractor companies in the corruption scandals have left no one to work on big infrastructure projects in the country\n",
      "\n",
      "1|According to consultancy firm Tendências, domestic investments shrunk 6 per cent in 2016 alone (Ribeiro and Cortez, 2016).\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Besides investments, the Car Wash Operations as well as the impeachment impacted Brazil's GDP. Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate how the economy shrunk since 2013\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Figure 2 in particular show how the economy contracted, thus taking the country into a severe recession. Alessandra Ribeiro, from Tendências, has argued that the Petrolão is a factor that potentialized the contraction of the GDP\n",
      "\n",
      "1|For her, two out the 3.8 per cent decline in economic growth relates back to the scandals (Ribeiro and Cortez, 2016).\n",
      "\n",
      "2|A decline in economic activity came in tandem with a rise in inflation as well as in the unemployment rate. In this case, the impacts of the two events analyzed might be indirectly related, nonetheless still present\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The mismanagement of the economy has caused inflation to reach almost 11 per cent in 2015. This inflation, followed by the lack of investments, and the decline in economic activity may have decreased the number of jobs available in the market\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Figures 4 and 5 show the price fluctuation as well as the unemployment rate in the last years. For Bruno Lavieri, \"blaming the Car Wash Operation [for unemployment and stagnation] is like blaming the doctor for finding his patient's disease.\" However, as GO Associates have argued, this indirect impact of the investigations have costed more than 2 million jobs in two years due to the lack of infrastructure projects with Petrobras and contractor companies (UOL, 2016)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Petrobras alone composed 13 per cent of the economic activities in Brazil (Petrobras, 2016). According to Getúlio Vargas Foundation, \"the decrease in Petrobras' activities due to the Car Wash Operations could take away R$7 billion from the economy, lead to the loss of more than 1 million vacancies and a R$ 5.7 billion fall in the collection of taxes by the Union, states and municipalities in 2015\" (UOL, 2016).\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Although the impeachment and the corruption scandal did not singlehandedly cause Brazil's economic recession, they shone a light on major existent structural problems such as corruption, fiscal pedals, lack of investments, and poor allocation of resources. Moreover, both events indirectly contributed, even though did not cause, the economic crisis\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The corruption scandal influenced the decline in economic activities and lack of investments in the country, which subsequently increased the unemployment rate. In addition, inflation became rampant and political instability remained\n",
      "\n",
      "1|With that, government expenditures increased and private savings decreased significantly, as Figure 6 reveals.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Figure 6: Composition of Brazil's GDP in terms of private consumption, current account balance, government expenditure, and private savings. Source: World Bank Data\n",
      "\n",
      "2|With Michel Temer's administration comes new challenges. Foreign and domestic investors remain skeptical of Brazil's economic and political situation\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Unemployment and inflation remains high, investments remain low, and the Brazilian Real continues depreciated. Since his inauguration, Temer dedicated most of his time and effort to get Bill 241 approved in Congress\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This Bill proposes to reduce public spending and to balance the public accounts by freezing government expenditures in the next twenty years (Alessi, 2016). However, getting Bill 241 approved is not everything\n",
      "\n",
      "1|President Temer will have to address several other factors such as Social Security and Tax reforms, unemployment rate, social 49 agenda, and Congress polarization to be able to recover from the economic and political instability that the Car Wash Operations shone a light to.\n",

      "2|Economic regionalism has been an observable phenomenon worldwide. Many countries around the world pursue some degree of economic integration with neighbouring countries, in the hopes of capitalizing on the benefits of such an arrangement\n",
      "\n",
      "2|At the turn of the 21st century, there already existed various regional economic institutions, including the highly integrated Eurozone in Europe and the East African Community (EAC) for continental Africa. This is in addition to a proliferation of bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) between countries, which can be regional or cross regional in nature\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Many Asian countries, including South Korea, China and Singapore, have also been active participants in these economic processes, with many FTAs signed intra and inter-region. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),2 recognizing the preponderant benefits that can be derived from trade ties, have been among the most vocal advocates of economic regionalism, an institution that goes beyond bilateral FTAs\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Unlike bilateral FTAs, regional institutions include more than just two parties, thereby enabling more countries to benefit from trade together. Against this backdrop, the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) is currently being implemented incrementally by all member states, according to a chronological roadmap\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The AEC is expected to deliver substantial economic gains to all member countries, including increased access to regionally produced goods, better allocation of capital resources and overall improvement of economic well-being to the people in ASEAN. Yet, the creation of the AEC did not come without its obstacles\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Much effort was – and continues to be channeled towards coordination, alignment of interests and resolution of conflicts. As is encountered even in the Eurozone and the EAC mentioned earlier, all regional economic institutions have to overcome various establishment and maintenance problems that can hinder the efficacy and effectiveness of such institutions\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Thus far, the AEC appears to be coping with these barriers well. If it can do so successfully, the economic benefits accrued to member countries will be considerable.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Economic integration provides promise of improving societal welfare through market mechanisms, but also closer inter-state ties and improved intra-regional peace and stability. Much scholarship has been devoted towards exploring the political difficulties that undergird economic integration\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Tensions from historical or ideological issues have been attributed as problems that hinder cooperation.3 Therefore, a common line of argumentation could hold that resolving these political problems must occur prior to cooperation between these states. However, evidence on this count is inconclusive\n",
      "\n",
      "2|For example, the United States (U.S) and China were able to set aside ideological differences, despite decades of tension, in favour of cooperating against the Soviet Union. This implies that the tangible benefits from economic integration could provide the motivation to isolating or resolving major political differences\n",
      "\n",
      "2|If there are clear material benefits at stake, as in the Soviet threat of the 1970s, there are reasonable grounds to posit that states may be willing to pursue self-interest before considering less immediate and non-threatening problems, such as ideology. As this paper will show, the AEC is a powerful force promoting peace in the Southeast Asian region\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Greater labour mobility within this region, coupled with the material gains from collective economic growth are major stabilizers that mitigate unnecessary conflict. In other words, national behaviour increasingly adapts to ensure that economic development is prioritized\n",
      "\n",
      "1|If a government cannot guarantee its people security in their basic material needs, then there can be no foundation to pursuing higher-level, abstract goals such as ideological legitimization.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Assuming the logic of economic integration holds true, Northeast Asia stands to profit immensely if the region creates a similarly structured economic institution. As such, this paper argues that Northeast Asia's ability to increase economic integration's viability can be greatly enhanced by understanding how ASEAN has approached the creation of the AEC\n",
      "\n",
      "2|There are both economic and political-security benefits which can greatly enhance the attractiveness of creating a \"Northeast Asian Economic Community\" (NAEC). In the first section of this paper, I perform a case study of ASEAN to better understand the actual and potential benefits of the AEC's creation, followed by a distillation of lessons that can be learnt, pertaining to how major barriers to successful economic integration have been and are still being -mitigated\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The second section will then proceed to examine the benefits of forming the NAEC and suggest how, by way of the ASEAN experience, significant barriers to economic integration can be overcome to increase the possibility of successfully creating the envisaged NAEC. The final part of this paper will articulate the possibility of a more encompassing East Asian economic community, contingent on the success of the AEC and NAEC.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Historically, Southeast Asia was a major node in the international trade network, exposed to major movements of goods between different nations around the world. Following post-colonialism, however, many member countries turned to import-substitution industrialization in order to develop their economies\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In recent decades, more countries have increasingly embraced the idea of free trade, persuaded by the benefits that it can provide. The ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) was conceptualised in 2003, following the meeting of ASEAN headsofstate in Indonesia, and is part of a larger concept of regional integration.4 The AEC aims to create a common economic platform that will facilitate the participation and trade of ASEAN member countries\n",

      "2|Its main pillars are: 1) a single market and production base; 2) a competitive economic region; 3) equitable economic development; and 4) integration into the global economy.5 With the integration of the AEC, the total value of the economic market is estimated at US$2.3 trillion.6 As a large market with considerable promise, the AEC is an attractive region for robust economic growth. It is in this regard that many countries have been convinced to participate in the AEC, as the tangible and rational benefits accrued to each country will go a long way in promoting the economic health and societal welfare of their respective countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|First, the AEC provides countries with incentives to align their production bases according to their comparative advantages. For many Southeast Asian countries, most countries retain a large agrarian base, with only a few having successfully transitioned to a more capital-intensive economy.7 For example, Singapore and Malaysia are the leading economies in the region and both have considerable infrastructure tailored to meet the needs of a more knowledge-based, high-value economy\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This is aligned with their comparative advantages, especially so for Singapore. Public universities, such as the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University, have consistently been recognized for academic excellence in various world rankings, while other technical and vocational training institutes provide Singaporeans with the needed skills that employers from MNCs look for.8,9 As a result, Singapore in general has emerged as a strong and competitive economy\n",
      "\n",
      "2|On the other hand, the Philippines, with a large agrarian base, is presently much poorer than Singapore. Without specialization, it will be difficult for the Philippines to achieve economies of scale via large-scale efficient production of goods according to their comparative advantage in primary products, such as agricultural goods.10 The AEC aims to address this by encouraging economies to re-align according to their strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1|In doing so, other trading partners within the AEC will benefit from lower prices, thereby enhancing consumer welfare.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Second, the AEC effectively creates an integrated market for 611 million consumers.11 A large consumer base will be advantageous to many firms located within member countries, as their product reach will be greater than before. Where successful integration without significant trade barriers prevails, social welfare improves as raw material and final product prices are not unnecessarily distorted\n",
      "\n",
      "2|It is little wonder, therefore, that many countries are receptive of the AEC since this will increase both domestic consumption and export expenditure, enhancing the interest of their respective business sectors. Consumers in the AEC will be exposed to even more product choice, variety and nature at a higher level of quantity and quality\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Already, benefits have been apparent. For example, Jollibee, a fast food restaurant chain from the Philippines, has successfully expanded its operations into nine of the ten ASEAN nations as a result of lower trade and investment barriers\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Today, its operations are worth a total of US$866 million.12 The presence of a large market is also effective in attracting foreign direct investment from other parts of the world. This sentiment was captured in a survey by the US Chamber of Commerce, which polled and discovered that 54% of American firms have plans that involve expanding into ASEAN.13 Such investments can go a long way in strengthening the regional economy even further, thereby enhancing the overall returns to integration\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Specifically, more jobs can be created and economic development achieved. Effectively, consumers will benefit alongside business and every country is moved along in this cycle of economic prosperity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Third, the AEC's success can promote greater regional peace and ameliorate security-related challenges. Economic competition has often been implicated in political conflicts among states (Le Billon, 2004)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The presence of the AEC provides all states with positive security externalities, specifically, a buffer against unnecessary conflict caused by economic fundamentals. Under conditions of shared economic growth and prioritized economic cooperation, the benefits of a successful AEC will be enjoyed by all ASEAN states\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Fostering an economic community can also provide additional benefits to regional peace, following economic liberalism. According to economic interdependence theory, states that form a network of cross-border cutting economic ties will be more disposed towards peace and less towards conflict\n",
      "\n",
      "2|If the theory is true, the presence of the AEC will be a major driver of regional peace in ASEAN. While no studies have been conducted in ASEAN yet, economic interdependence theory tentatively has some support from research conducted by Russett and Oneal, who established the presence of a positive relationship between trade and peace.14 This is salient, as ASEAN leaders such as Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong have identified growing nationalism as a threat to regional stability.15 Integration in the economic sphere, in turn, can serve as a viable launch pad for better and more stable political and social relations across the region\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Building a stable and powerful AEC will be advantageous to promoting peace in Southeast Asia, a goal that is desirable in the context of greater political conflict among East Asian states. This being achieved, peace in Southeast Asia will be a good base to enhance peace in the greater East Asia region.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Following the above, it is apparent that economic cooperation is desirable as it provides economies access to a larger market, fosters economic competitiveness and carries positive security externalities. Together, these attractive \"push\" factors encourage states to seek out such an arrangement\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Against this backdrop, there is cautious optimism that Northeast Asia can achieve similar results, if a similar economic community can be mooted. Should major economies such as China, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea come together to form a coherent economic multi-lateral institution, there is a high chance that these countries can enjoy the economic benefits that AEC member states will share\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Yet, such communities are not naturally formed, owing to various barriers that can discourage countries from associating into an economic community. This section will enumerate three major difficulties associated with national-level economic organizations\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Every multi-member organization is prone to conflict among constituent members owing to different priorities, norms and domestic needs. ASEAN is no stranger to these issues\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Specifically, the issues under discussion are: 1) the dumping of excess produced goods in other countries' markets; 2) the extent of protectionism that hinders full economic integration; and 3) undesirable labour-side effects caused by labour mobility.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Countries able to manufacture cheaper goods tend to export such goods overseas upon saturation of the local market, leading to greater competition and declining profitability of recipient country firms. This condition, known as dumping, is a recurrent problem found in economic zones with members being in different stages of economic development.16 Assuming free trade and a country X with a strong comparative advantage in good A, compared to countries Y and Z, the latter two countries will experience an influx of good A from X, leading to an outcompeting of domestic producers in Y and Z who lack the level of efficiency needed to provide similar goods at more competitive rates\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This has been a problem faced in various regions, whereby the movement of goods according to comparative advantage has meant a decrease in earnings from domestic industries, who are unable to compete with more efficient producers from other countries. As a result, this phenomenon of dumping causes domestic producers to be squeezed out of the production market, leading to negative effects on the economy's production capacity as a whole\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Of greater salience in politics, the marginalization of local sectors in business can foment greater resentment and demands placed on the government to protect their interests better. Should the government heed this call and respond in favour of their businesses, the resultant situation can be detrimental to the overall fabric of the regional outfit writ-large.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In ASEAN, this problem of dumping has been averted by negotiating and re-aligning comparative advantages while embracing the overall enhancing effects on consumer surplus. The ASEAN institution leverages greatly on such conciliatory negotiation mechanisms that aim to produce consensus among member states.17 This minimizes any consequent disagreements that can impede successful policy implementation\n",
      "\n",
      "2|According to an ANZ Bank analyst, the ASEAN countries will likely structure their economies to match their resource endowments, with Singapore and Malaysia developing \"into service and financial hubs for the region\" while Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam move into middle-end manufacturing, while Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia, will leverage on its physical resources for lower-value manufacturing.18 This indicates that no particular industry will see inefficient and large-scale production of any goods or services. Instead, countries largely avoid the narrow concentration of industrial efforts on similar products and focus on their niche areas of production\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Hence, this reduces any surplus production needing to be \"dumped\" in regional markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Economic integration can be greatly hindered when member countries refuse to abide by agreed upon regulations permitting movement of goods and services across borders. This is commonly done by raising barriers to mobility, a practice officially known as protectionism\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Traditional protectionist measures include tariffs and quotas on foreign imports, while modern protectionist measures typically involve regulations on product content requirements.19 Countries may adopt protectionism so as to protect their domestic industries from more efficient foreign competitors, which may have repercussions on domestic employment. Another reason for protectionism may be to pander to business groups with powerful influence and ties with politicians.20 Such businesses understandably do not wish to see an erosion of profits, which competition brings about generally\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Still, despite such justifications, protectionist measures militate against the creation of an integrated and accessible economic community. These barriers prevent free flow of goods and services from one country to another, contradicting the basic tenet of economic integration.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|ASEAN countries have tackled this problem by collaboratively building consensus about the disavowing of protectionism. This was embodied most clearly in the communique released after the ASEAN Summit in 2015, whereby ASEAN affirmed its commitment to eliminating trade tariffs, of which nearly 96% have been eliminated.21 Incrementally, every country has been reducing restrictions on competition in protected sectors such as banking, which is a major source of revenue for economies. The commitment to protectionism can be seen in agreements signed within the AEC, including the ASEAN Comprehensive Investment Agreement (ACIA). The ACIA institutionalizes each country's commitment to liberalize their business sectors and this has \"eased restrictions to cross-border trade.\"22 This is supplemented by the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement, a \"legal framework to realize the free flow of goods within the AEC.\" Consequently, much progress has been made in the AEC, whereby more than \"70% of intra-regional trade\" now has zero tariffs across 80 sub-sectors.23 With more time given, the rate of further liberalization is expected to increase given the continued commitment of political leaders to the AEC's cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Labor movement can be both a source of benefit and conflict to the receiving society, which may not always embrace foreigner inflows. This poses a formidable obstacle to any plans for full-scale economic integration, since any failure to permit free labour flow can go against a fundamental tenet of a shared economic community\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In theory, free labour flow is beneficial because it can correct any asymmetry in the labour market by ensuring that workers move to where they are in demand from places where they are currently unemployed due to undersupply of jobs.24 Furthermore, these workers are likely to have received education and training in their home countries prior to movement to other countries, being a big advantage to the latter. Such prior training greatly reduces the need to equip these workers with basic skills, a source of cost savings for the receiving country\n",
      "\n",
      "2|However, labour factors, despite their advantages for the receiving economy, interact with socio-cultural cleavages at the same time. Locals may perceive foreigners to be taking their jobs, fomenting greater resentment as a result\n",
      "\n",
      "1|How have affected ASEAN countries dealt with this? To provide a more detailed analysis, here this paper examines a single case, Singapore, in detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Being an advanced economy, Singapore is attractive to many foreign workers around the world. This ranges from lower-value employment such as in construction and the service industry, of which most workers tend to be from neighbouring ASEAN countries and South Asia, to high-value employment in sectors such as banking and Information Technology (IT).25 Such workers can come from any part of the world, with the critical distinction being their professional qualifications and experience. Due to rapid development, alignment with comparative advantage, and a small labour force, Singapore has relied on foreigners to fill gaps in the various sectors, with most of them found in the lower-value sectors.26 The reason for this is that, since Singapore's only valuable resource endowment is human capital, such capital must be upgraded to be of higher value in order to sustain the economy's development.27 As such, labour shortages are found more in the sectors of construction and ancillary public services such as cleaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|However, Singaporean society has not taken well to such measures and has displayed occasional resistance to the foreign labour policy of the government. This has sometimes translated into strong pressure on elected politicians to manage the policy better by slowing down the rate of uptake\n",
      "\n",
      "2|As society's support is essential to any public policy, the state is unable to ignore public opinion. To this end, Singapore has been more careful and calibrated in its approach to foreign worker inflows\n",
      "\n",
      "2|There are categories of employment that require different skill sets, and are open to different nationalities.28 In labour intensive sectors, the government does not appear to be intervening extensively, since such labour flows are transient and do not significantly pose problems to society. For the professional sectors, depending on deemed merit and worthiness, foreigners are eligible for Permanent Resident status or Singaporean citizenship itself\n",
      "\n",
      "2|It is in this domain that discernible change is apparent, with majority beneficiaries being other ASEAN countries, while those from South Asia and other regions are in the minority. In 2013 for example, 55.3% of new PRs were from ASEAN countries while 34.6% came from other Asian countries such as India and China.29\n",
      "\n",
      "2|On the societal frontier, the government has become more active in its drive to clarify the misconceptions related to foreign workers taking jobs away from locals, backed up with actual policies to lend such messages more credence. For example, companies must list openings for certain jobs one month prior to opening them up to foreigners.30 In addition, the number of foreign workers allowed for hire by a company is determined by a pre-set ratio of local to foreign labour.31 This means that firms must hire local workers before they can be allowed to hire foreigners\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Together, these policies aim to assuage public concerns by showing that the government is monitoring labour inflows and ensuring no undesirable side effects on society writ large. This is a strategy that dovetails with larger AEC goals\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Singapore has continued to privilege AEC partners in its foreign labour policies, as seen in the above proxy indicator of majority ASEAN PR and citizenship grants, supporting the AEC's eventual ideal of free labour mobility. In this regard, there are positive steps being taken to ensure that, despite societal resistance, Singapore's cooperation and compliance with AEC goals are not compromised, but have been managed in order to ensure smooth policy development and acceptance.Continued on Next Page »\n",

      "3|The rapid approval and subsequent global rollout of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 has inevitably resulted in reports of adverse events after receipt of the vaccine. Most adverse events reported thus far have been associated with risks similar to background risks in the general population and have not raised concerns. However, for very rare events with complex diagnostic algorithms, the background risks may be difficult to measure or interpret.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|We report the detection of anti-PF4 antibodies, unrelated to the use of heparin therapy, in a mostly young, generally healthy cohort of patients presenting with acute atypical thrombosis, primarily involving the cerebral veins, and concurrent thrombocytopenia. All the patients had d-dimer levels at presentation that were much higher than would be expected in patients with acute venous thromboembolism13 and are typically seen in patients with cancer.14 The very conservative d-dimer cutoff used in our algorithm, of 4000 FEU, was chosen to ensure that cases were not missed and were considered for further testing, because there is a possibility that a spectrum of severity in this syndrome could be missed otherwise. In all the patients, manifestations occurred 6 to 24 days after the administration of the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|HIT is a progressive thrombotic condition that can cause both venous and arterial thrombosis, typically 5 to 14 days after exposure to heparin. It is more common in female patients, particularly those who receive unfractionated heparin during cardiac surgery, as well as in patients who receive heparin after surgery, especially cardiac and orthopedic procedures.15 Diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of anti-PF4 antibodies.16,17\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Data describing the rare detection of pathologic anti-PF4 antibodies unrelated to the use of heparin therapy are limited.18,19 Furthermore, the analysis of anti-PF4 antibodies appears to be specific to the given assay. In our study, confirmation of ELISA results for anti-PF4 antibodies was undertaken with the use of a functional HIT assay. The clinical features of this vaccine-induced syndrome are more typical of those seen in patients with HIT who have early reexposure to heparin, including severe thrombocytopenia, aggressive thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.20\n",
      "\n",
      "4|The risk of thrombocytopenia and the risk of venous thromboembolism after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 do not appear to be higher than the background risks in the general population, a finding consistent with the rare and sporadic nature of this syndrome. Furthermore, headaches, fevers, and muscle aches have occurred after vaccination for 48 to 72 hours in some patients. The events reported in this study appear to be rare, and until further analysis is performed, it is difficult to predict who may be affected. The symptoms developed more than 5 days after the first vaccine dose, reflecting an immunologic pattern similar to that of HIT.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|We have identified a novel mechanism and pathophysiological basis that prompts careful consideration of treatment. Avoidance of platelet transfusions is critical, because such treatment would provide a substrate for further antibody-mediated platelet activation and coagulopathy\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The exact nature of these pathologic antibodies has not been characterized, but they appear to be of the IgG subtype, and platelet activation can be completely abrogated with an excess of heparin, as seen in classic HIT. Identification of the mechanism through which the vaccine could trigger the formation of these pathologic antibodies would require further study\n",
      "\n",
      "1|An understanding of the precise pathophysiological mechanism may allow for more targeted therapeutic interventions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Although evidence does not yet suggest that the use of heparin will exacerbate this condition, pending further data, we would recommend considering anticoagulation with the use of a nonheparin anticoagulant agent, such as argatroban, danaparoid, fondaparinux, or direct oral anticoagulants. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) has been used successfully in the treatment of patients with “spontaneous” autoimmune HIT, which is the closest comparison to this vaccine-induced syndrome, and IVIG would be expected to have direct antibody-mediated toxic effects.21-23 Plasma exchange with plasma rather than albumin could also be effective in temporarily reducing levels of pathologic antibodies and providing some correction of the coagulopathy in terms of the hypofibrinogenemia.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|A suggested algorithm for identification of vaccine-induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia is presented and can be adapted as we generate further information. The combination of thrombosis and an apparent consumptive coagulopathy poses a dilemma with respect to the benefits and risks associated with aggressive anticoagulation\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This dilemma is especially relevant in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis, in whom bleeding could be catastrophic but withholding anticoagulation could be equally harmful. It is unclear whether delaying aggressive anticoagulation until after initial disease control with IVIG or plasma exchange is warranted, but mortality among patients with cerebral venous thrombosis appears to be higher than expected, so early treatment decisions are likely to be critical\n",
      "\n",
      "1|There is no evidence that heparin alternatives are required; however, in view of the similarity of this syndrome to conventional HIT, alternatives could be considered until further data are available.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|In all cases reported to date, this syndrome of thrombocytopenia and venous thrombosis appears to be triggered by receipt of the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Although there have been a few reports of patients with symptoms consistent with this clinical syndrome after the receipt of other vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, none have yet been confirmed to fulfill the diagnostic criteria, specifically the presence of thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, a very high d-dimer level, and a low or normal fibrinogen level. Furthermore, in Israel, where two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer–BioNTech) have been provided to more than 4 million people, no cases of this rare syndrome have been reported. Although natural SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with thromboembolic phenomena, those events differ from the specific syndrome described in this study.\n",

      "2|The risk of Covid-19 remains a serious public health consideration worldwide, and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 provides critical protection.24 There is a substantial risk of ascertainment bias when associating adverse clinical events with vaccination; however, the syndrome described in this study has a combination of clinical and laboratory features that is exceptional and has not been previously observed by any of the authors who are specialist hematologists or neurologists. Ongoing data collection and studies could help to establish whether and how the development of pathologic platelet-activating anti-PF4 antibodies, unrelated to the use of heparin therapy, could be associated with vaccination against SARS-CoV-2.\n",

      "3|Outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in the United States and in European countries in February 2020. Urgent action was called for, since experts estimated that 30 to 70% of people in these Western countries could become infected — a frightening projection at a time when the Covid-19 mortality rate was estimated to be substantially higher than we now know it to be. In March 2020, Michael Ryan, executive director of the Health Emergencies Program of the World Health Organization (WHO), implored countries to act, noting that when it comes to epidemic response, “speed trumps perfection” but “the greatest error is not to move.” At the time, the only tools for containing Covid-19 were social distancing, testing, case isolation, and contact tracing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Contact tracing is a crucial public health practice that has been a part of epidemic responses for centuries. From the bubonic plague, to smallpox and tuberculosis, to HIV, the fate of public health has relied on our ability to identify people who have been in contact with infected people\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In the case of Covid-19, however, the short time between symptom onset in the infector and that in the infected and the virus’s propensity for asymptomatic transmission posed challenges for contact tracing. Recall bias, the inability to identify contacts who are unknown to the infected person, and a shortage of trained contact tracers were additional challenges\n",
      "\n",
      "1|There was an urgent need to augment the scale and rapidity of contact tracing to identify everyone who had been exposed to Covid-19.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Twenty-first–century digital technology had the potential to enable this escalation. Modeling studies suggested that if digital contact-tracing apps were combined with other mitigation measures, Covid-19 epidemics could be slowed and theoretically even ended.1 Lessons can be learned from the deployment of digital technologies to augment contact tracing during this pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|The most basic measures of the effectiveness of a pandemic response are case numbers and deaths. By these measures, South Korea’s response during its first wave of Covid-19 was highly successful. Having experienced the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2015, the South Korean people and their political leaders understood the need for early recognition of the pandemic threat and a corresponding robust response. They successfully integrated a rapidly scaled diagnostic capacity and contact-tracing system with effective isolation and quarantine measures.\n",

      "2|A key part of the South Korean contact-tracing system was digital contact-tracing technology. Legislative changes in South Korea arising from the MERS outbreak gave health authorities a legal foundation for using geolocation data for contact tracing from the very outset of their epidemic\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Global positioning system (GPS) data from cell phones were used to create a centralized database of the movements of people with Covid-19 that was accessible online. The Corona 100m app used these data to warn users when they were near a location visited by an infected person\n",
      "\n",
      "1|This intervention interfered with the privacy, data protection, and civil liberties of infected people, but it aimed to disrupt transmission chains to protect society’s most vulnerable members.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|In most Western countries, no such effort to enhance contact tracing using automation was implemented early in the epidemic. Without prior experience in responding to epidemics in this way, many leaders and citizens found it inconceivable that personal privacy and data protection rights could be ceded to health protection. Yet the fact that many people in Western countries already permit collection of geolocation data by other apps that provide little personal benefit suggests that the resistance to doing so for health protection, while well intended, may have been misguided.2\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Automation using geolocation tracking allowed teams of epidemiologic investigators in South Korea to trace not only contacts but also the setting in which contact occurred up to 14 days before symptom onset or diagnosis. This information allowed them to gain a greater understanding of the settings in which SARS-CoV-2 transmission was occurring and to implement more targeted health protection measures in response\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In contrast, traditional contact-tracing systems in most Western countries had the capacity to identify and notify only people who had come into contact with an infected person within 48 hours before symptom onset or diagnosis. This digital limitation perhaps contributed to the first wave of Covid-19 in Western countries that outpaced the epidemic in South Korea\n",

      "4|Digital contact tracing is not a perfect intervention, given the risks to privacy, personal data, and false positive or false negative characterization of contact status. However, as in a Swiss cheese model, imperfect interventions can work together to curb epidemics. South Korea’s deployment of digital technology to augment contact tracing was an example of speed trumping perfection, whereas Europe made the greatest error described by Ryan of the WHO: not to move. Having learned from this experience, Europeans may be much more amenable to sharing location data for contact tracing in health emergencies.3 It should help in combating the next pandemic that the balance between preserving privacy and preserving life has changed during this pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|As the first epidemic wave came to an end and the imminent threat of further loss of life eased, geolocation-based digital contact-tracing systems and their interference with personal privacy and data protection rights became less palatable. They became the subject of intense scrutiny in countries that used them, including South Korea and also Norway and Israel. In a pandemic that had the potential to last several years, many Western countries recognized the need for trustworthy, transparent, privacy-preserving digital contact-tracing technologies that were acceptable to Western populations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Challenges remain, however. Integration of digital contact-tracing technologies with existing test-and-trace systems appears to be an important determinant of their utility.5 More importantly, digital contact-tracing technologies must be made accessible, particularly to people with limited access to smartphone technology, those with limited digital health literacy, speakers of languages other than a country’s primary language, and migrant communities. Increasing accessibility is important not only for maximizing uptake, but also for ensuring that all members of society can benefit equitably from digital advances in contact tracing. If these challenges can be overcome, Western countries will have gained a trustworthy, privacy-preserving, accessible tool to use during the next pandemic to enhance contact-tracing capacity and control disease spread until elimination is achieved.\n",

In transplanted patients, the incidence was 1.7% (16/917).

In group 2, all the 31 patients were on hemodialysis treatment. In groups 1 and 2, the artificial replacement treatments were performed in dedicated rooms (isolated from the conventional Dialysis Center) with continuous or intermittent standard techniques, depending on the specific situation.

After the diagnosis of COVID-19, all the patients were initially hospitalized (range of hospitalization length: 3–58 days), due to comorbidities related to chronic renal failure and/or immunodepression for the transplant recipients.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The treatment interventions were based on the experience of the center. During hospitalization, 5 patients, all of them in group 2, did not require oxygen therapy. In the remaining 44 patients, varying degrees of respiratory failure was reported: in 20 of them (3 in group 1, 13 in group 2, and 4 in group 3), low-flow oxygen therapy (<6 L/min) was delivered using nasal cannulas or simple face masks, 18 (2 in group 1, 12 in group 2, and 4 in group 3) were treated with noninvasive ventilation by continuous positive airway pressure, and/or high-flow nasal cannulas, and 6 (2 in group 1, 1 in group 2, and 3 in group 3) required tracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The majority of the patients (95%) received different therapy schemes over time based on antiviral agents (hydroxychloroquine, darunavir/ritonavir, or lopinavir/ritonavir) and/or with tocilizumab and azithromycin. The distribution of the different drug regimes in the 3 groups are depicted in Table 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In all the transplant recipients under triple-drug immunosuppression regimen, mycophenolate or mTOR were withdrawn; also in 3 patients, calcineurin inhibitors were suspended during COVID-19 infection. Conversely, steroid therapy was always maintained or even enhanced.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The overall timing until SARS-CoV-2 negativization (documented by 2 consecutive negative swabs) in the total population of 49 recovered subjects was 32.4 ± 12.3 days (median: 31 days; range 15–58 days). This time span to achieve viral clearance was 38.8 ± 13.3 days in group 1 (34 days; range 24–56 days), 30.8 ± 12.2 days in group 2 (median: 30 days; range 15–58 days), and 32.8 ± 11.6 days in group 3 (median of 30 days; range 17–50 days), with no significant intergroup differences (p = n.s., ANOVA test). Time to negativization did not show any significant correlation with clinical severity at onset, antiviral therapy, or immunosuppressive regimen (transplant group).\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Three patients (1 in each group) experienced a relapse of COVID-19 infection after 8–13 days from the laboratory recovery. In all the 3 cases, the viral load was significantly lower than that found at the first infection. The following nasopharyngeal swabs showed persistent negativity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Both IgG and IgM against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in all patients since the first measurement following PCR negativization (range 3–8 days). In the first serological samples, the sample/cutoff (S/CO) index for IgG ranged from 0.93 to 12.12 (mean 7.78) and S/CO index for IgM ranged from 0.2 to 9.4 (mean 1.08). The semiquantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the patients who underwent at least 2 serological tests revealed a progressive increase of IgG index up to 37.5% and a concurrent slow decline of IgM index up to 94%.\n",

      "4|At the time of data collection, patients treated for COVID-19 infection, were in stable clinical conditions and no significant organ damage was reported, except 1 single patient with decompensated renal failure (group 1) who is still dependent on artificial replacement treatment. Other 6 patients of group 1 achieved a partial functional recovery with respect to preinfective period (as indicated by the mild eGFR reduction to 21.6 ± 9.0 mL/min). In transplanted patients, the eGFR was also moderately decreased compared to the preinfection period (40.6 ± 14.05 vs. 47.7 ± 25.4 mL/min, p = n.s.).\n",
      "\n",
      "2|SARS-CoV-2 infection is having a tremendous impact on national health systems worldwide. Our data confirm the increased susceptibility to COVID-19 of patients with advanced-stage renal failure [20], under chronic dialysis therapy [21, 22] and kidney transplant recipients [23] compared to the general population, as previously reported in Italy and other industrialized countries [8, 24, 25].\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The elevated incidence observed especially in hemodialysis patients is mainly related to the frequent access to the hospital, to the duration of individual treatments, implying a prolonged contact with other patients and health-care personnel, and the necessity of transportation to reach the dialysis center [2]. In our experience, no CO­VID-19-positive case were found among patients under peritoneal dialysis, thus confirming the advantages related to a home treatment, as already highlighted by recent evidence [26, 27].\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The overall mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Italy was 11.6%; a worse outcome is reported in patients with chronic diseases and cardiovascular comorbidity [28]. Consistent with previous reports [24, 25], our population showed an elevated death rate (22.2% in patients with decompensated renal failure, 38.0% in dialysis patients, and 31.2% in transplant recipients), confirming the fragility of chronic nephropathic patients, in spite of the timely therapy against COVID-19 given in most of the cases and the reduction of immunosuppression in transplanted patients. Sadly, the work suffers from the heterogeneity of therapeutic intervention for COVID-19, mainly related to the period in which the study was conducted, the early stages of the pandemic outbreak in Italy, when a reference treatment scheme was not well defined yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|There was also a different diagnostic approach to the infection in the 3 study groups; among hemodialysis patients, the diagnosis was occasional in 10% of them during the screening for procedure execution not related to COVID-19 (preparation for instrumental examinations and scheduled hospitalizations) and in 15% for reporting contacts with positive cases. In transplant recipients, managed mainly at home, nasopharyngeal swab sampling was always performed for clinical reasons (fever and respiratory symptoms of variable severity), but this might have led to an underestimation of the incidence of infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Our data highlighted a partial worsening of kidney function following COVID-19 infection in patients with advanced chronic renal failure and transplant recipients, but the short observation period prevents us to draw any firm conclusions on this point. The management of chronic nephropathic patients is complex and involves personalized pathways for those who experienced CO­VID-19\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Here, we tried mainly to evaluate the expected time of nasopharyngeal swab negativization in patients who, for different reasons, have an impaired immune response capacity. Even if the evolution of the single case cannot be generalized, a better understanding of the average time span to achieve viral clearance and antibody response in these weak populations might provide useful references for the planning of health-care activities and the logistic needs for therapeutic interventions\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Unsurprisingly, our renal patients showed a slower viral clearance (32.4 ± 12.3 days) than that found in the general population, even in the context of a wide heterogeneity [11, 12, 29]. Moreover, the time to negativization was also longer in the patients diagnosed for COVID-19 due to sporadic cases or due to contact with an ascertained positive case.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|In our case history, the time to viral clearance was moderately longer in patients with metabolic decompensation during infection, but we did not find significant differences between 3 groups of patients. The relatively small sample size and the heterogeneity of therapeutic approaches did not allow identification of a correlation between the time to negativization and antiviral therapy or clinical presentation at onset. Similarly, in transplant patients, no correlation with the immunosuppression regimen was possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The overall message emerging from our data indicates a delayed viral clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and can be interpreted in view of the cellular and humoral immunodepression typical of this population [7, 30, 31]. Comparably to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has been proven to induce a T-lymphocyte-mediated immune response, but this protective mechanism might be suppressed in patients with lymphopenia, including those under chronic hemodialysis and renal transplant recipients [32, 33].\n",
      "\n",
      "2|A striking finding was the discovery of 3 reinfections in patients who, in a time span ranging between 8 and 13 days following laboratory recovery, showed PCR positivity. It must be specified that swab sampling was performed due to subjective symptoms (fever or high respiratory tract inflammation), not through systematic search, and this might have possibly underestimated the rate of reinfection\n",
      "\n",
      "2|It is known that the nasopharyngeal swab test has some limitations: the sensitivity is about 80%, implying that in up to 20–30% the test can produce false negatives, mainly related to too early timing of the sampling or human error in collecting adequate material. This limited accuracy suggests some caution before the complete reintroduction of patients with previous infection into the open-space sections of hemodialysis or in transplant follow-up surgeries\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Applying a principle of extreme prudence in order to protect other fragile patients, the ones recovered from COVID-19 should be managed in filter zones for a period of 15–20 days. The development of rapid tests and/or highly accurate assays able to define the presence of the virus and not only of parts of the genome may be helpful in the near future.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Serological tests represent a useful integration of nasopharyngeal swab data. In our experience, all the patients treated for the infection have developed an antibody response, with a progressive increase and subsequent stabilization of IgG associated with a slow reduction or disappearance of IgM\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The interpretation of serological tests remains complex and must be integrated into the clinical context and with other laboratory investigations. The assay used for antibody detection has a good sensitivity and specificity\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The progressive reduction/disappearing of IgM is in line with the physiological immunological response. The finding of a prolonged persistence of IgM at the end of the observation period in 67% of our population studied is not a criterion of infection in progress\n",
      "\n",
      "2|These data should be confirmed in a larger population, a wider range of cases, also keeping in mind that the detection of IgM has a lower specificity (high false-positive rate) due to increased cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses [34, 35]. The serological study requires a prolonged monitoring to verify the antibody changes over time and their persistence\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The titration of IgG antibodies to identify a threshold level that confers an effective protection against the disease may represent a valuable tool for the recognition of immune subjects and for the possible management of vaccination programs. These first data on our renal patients show an overall satisfying antibody response capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|However, this study does not analyze the prognostic factors for COVID-19 recovery, which is still a matter of debate in current research. But to the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation focused on the time to reach viral clearance and the development of specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in different groups of chronic nephropathic patients\n",
      "\n",
      "2|From an epidemiological perspective, a systematic screening of this weak population is desirable, regardless of an acute symptomatology and/or a diagnosis of infection. The limitations of the study are related to its retrospective nature, based on the analysis of laboratory data, performed in a clinical context of a critical health emergency due to the peak of pandemic outbreak that did not allow a uniform assay schedule\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In particular, it was impossible to carry out the serology testing at programmed time points referred to the onset of infection (first positive swab) and to the moment of viral clearance (2 consecutive negative swabs). Another weakness is represented by the small sample size and the relatively short observation period\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Serological investigations were performed after nasopharyngeal swab negativization, and this does not consent a full evaluation of antibody kinetics since the initial stages of their production. Furthermore, since the observation period was February–April 2020 during the most dramatic stage of pandemic, our efforts at that time were focused on our nephropathic patients known to have an impaired immune response, and we did not include a control group of subjects hospitalized for COVID-19 with normal renal function.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The experience gained during the pandemic leads to some considerations on the structural reorganization of spaces and access/exit routes of the Nephrology and Hemodialysis Units. The importance of prophylaxis actions that must be constantly maintained remains unquestionable; obviously, the workload of the different structures is amplified, due to the strict necessity of adequate filter procedures.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|In conclusion, COVID-19 infection is a significant clinical problem in nephropathic patients and in kidney transplant recipients. Our findings reveal a delayed viral clearance in this fragile population, while there is a satisfying ability to produce specific antibodies. In a context still characterized by many clinical and epidemiological critical points, not fully clarified yet, a better understanding of the immune response in patients with unpaired renal function can represent a useful basis for further prospective research and in the management of vaccination programs. In weak populations with a high risk of morbidity and mortality, it is necessary to implement all the preventive measures to minimize the risk of COVID-19 infection and to identify positive patients at an early stage.\n",

      "2|Context: Chronic immunosuppression is associated with an increased risk of opportunistic infections. Although kidney transplant recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have higher mortality than the general population, data on their risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are unknown\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Subject of Review: A recent single-center screening study from the UK (Transplantation. 2021 Jan 1;105(1):151–7) showed that 89 (10.4%) of 855 consecutive kidney transplant recipients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Risk factors for infection included a nonwhite background, diabetes, and a history of allograft rejection. Risk factors for mortality in individuals who developed COVID-19 were older age and receiving steroids\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Second Opinion: This study shows that the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in kidney transplant recipients is similar to the one observed in the general population in the same area (13%), indicating that transplant recipients are not at increased risk of COVID-19. However, the investigators raise the interesting point that since transplant individuals were advised to shelter earlier than the general population, they may be in fact more susceptible\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This statement is hard to substantiate, but the identification of specific risk factors for infection and poor outcomes is crucial to tailor strategies to prevent spread of the infection. This is particularly important, considering that kidney transplant recipients may be at increased risk of prolonged viral spread and in-host viral mutations, making them not just a particularly fragile population for COVID-19 but also a potentially major source of further contagions.\n",

      "\n",
      "3|Immunosuppression is a major risk factor for opportunistic infections [1]. Therefore, since the very beginning of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, kidney transplant recipients have been considered a fragile population at higher risk of infection and poor outcomes [2, 3]. Finding that the most common risk factors for mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), such as older age, diabetes, and hypertension, are also common in transplanted individuals further supported this notion.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Initial series of hospitalized kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 showed alarming rates of mortality, between 25 and 35% [4]. These rates are higher than in-hospital case-fatality rates reported in the general population (ranging between 10 and 20%) [5-7]. However, there are also series showing that solid organ recipients have similar COVID-19-related mortality rates than the general population [8]. This suggests that such increased risk might be mitigated, for instance, by early hospitalization and a greater ease of access to intensive care unit [8].\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Progressive failure of most initially tested therapeutic approaches for COVID-19 further alarmed the transplant community that was progressively left without real therapeutic options. Effective prevention of COVID-19 infection in kidney transplant recipients, a population in need for frequent monitoring of graft function with blood draws, and often complex therapies has been therefore a challenging effort [9]. General measures for infectious disease prevention do apply to transplant patients, similar to the general population. However, identification of specific risk factors for infection may allow to strengthen rigor in selected patients, while avoiding excessive precautions in others, overall permitting a safe working and social activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In this context, we welcome the large serological screening by Willicombe et al. [10] providing new, important data on risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in kidney transplant recipients\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This study measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in 855 consecutive kidney transplant recipients out of a cohort of 1,250 patients followed at Imperial College Renal and Transplant Center, London, UK. Eighty-nine (10.4%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies\n",
      "\n",
      "2|For comparison, the seroprevalence in London around the same period was 13%. This supports the concept that kidney transplant recipients are at similar risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the general population\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Considering that transplant recipients were advised to shield in the UK months earlier than the general population and their generally more cautious attitude to limit exposure to infections, the authors of the study predicted a much lower exposure rate. However, the fact that family members may not always be as careful as the transplant recipients makes this conclusion hard to substantiate.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Ideally, viral PCR screening would be required to assess asymptomatic cases of infection. However, this approach is extremely demanding and would require serial tests to capture the infection in patients without symptoms\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Antiviral antibody measurement seems therefore the most effective approach as antibodies are thought to persist in the circulation for months after the infection, even in the asymptomatic cases. However, antibody screening has its own limitations as it may underestimate the prevalence of individuals who experienced viral infection\n",

      "2|In particular, kidney transplant recipients may not develop an effective antibody response, or anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may disappear weeks after infection. In this study, only 10% of patients with positive RT-PCR results did not have detectable antibodies at 1 month after infection, but this number could increase in patients with asymptomatic disease or at later time points after infection\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Therefore, the infection risk of transplant recipients may in fact be significantly higher than the one reported here.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The same UK group recently published in a separate article the comparisons between different anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays in supposedly the same cohort of patients [11]. They performed a comparison between 3 serological assays and found that the 2 immunoassays that tested for the presence of antibodies against the RBD of the S protein were superior to the one they used for the detection of antibodies reactive for the NP antigen.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In the UK study, risk factors for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies included a nonwhite background, a diagnosis of diabetes, and a history of allograft rejection. The association between ethnicity and diabetes with COVID-19 infection is consistent with risk factors for COVID-19 found in studies within the general population [12, 13] and with prior studies identifying common risk factors for posttransplant infections [14].\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Less clear is the association between acute rejection and increased infection risk, which could be related in part to the greater cumulative exposure to immunosuppressive drugs after rejection. It is also possible that rejection episodes were a sign of poor adherence to immunosuppressive therapy and, possibly, worse compliance to recommended medical preventive strategies against the virus\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The authors also emphasize that patients enrolled in this single-center study [10] received steroids only if they had prior rejection episodes or if they were using steroids before transplantation. Therefore, the rejection-associated risk could be driven by the use of steroids due to a prior episode, similar to the results of studies in other immunosuppressed populations, suggesting that glucocorticoid exposure increases the risk of severe COVID-19 disease [15]\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In this respect, it will be important to identify specific risk factors for steroid toxicity that put people at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. With the limitations of a single-center, cross-sectional study, this report provides important information in the identification of kidney transplant patients in whom preventive strategies should be reinforced the most.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|While high rates of infections and poor outcomes in transplant patients suggest an impaired immune response, the few available immune phenotypic analyses [16] and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody measurements in infected individuals did not detect major abnormalities. However, anti-SARS-CoV-2 T-cell responses in transplanted patients have not been investigated extensively.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|The anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies measured in the UK study were targeted against the RBD viral antigen [10]. There is evidence that anti-RBD antibodies may provide information on functional immunity, given reported correlations between RBD antibodies and neutralizing antibodies [17, 18]. However, ad hoc functional studies testing the viral-neutralizing capacity of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies produced by transplant recipients are needed. Understanding the antiviral response in kidney transplant recipients is key not just to interpret data of antibody screening studies but more importantly to manage immunosuppression during COVID-19 and for future vaccine strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|An immunosuppressive state may associate with higher risk of persistent infections and viral spread than people from the general population. It may also be associated with higher viral shedding\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Recently, the cases of immunocompromised individuals with persistent (over 5 months) viral infection have been reported [5, 19]. Importantly, ex vivo studies suggest that the virus that is persistently shed by immunosuppressed individuals would still be able to establish productive infection in contacts upon transmission [19]\n",
      "\n",
      "2|If confirmed also in transplanted individuals, this may suggest that longer quarantine periods and repeated negative tests may be needed for transplant recipients who recover from COVID-19. In particular, monitoring of genomic and subgenomic RNA might be required to exclude persistence of SARS-CoV-2 infection [19].\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Importantly, an immunocompromised state has been shown to accelerate in-host SARS-CoV-2 viral evolution and formation of new viral variants [5, 19]. Potential factors contributing to the observed within-host evolution is prolonged infection and the compromised immune status of the host, possibly resulting in a different set of selective pressures compared with an immune-competent host. This could be particularly important based on recent data suggesting that a more sustained antibody response and greater CD4+ T-cell activation with increased somatic mutations on B cells are associated with shorter disease trajectories [20]. Mutations that alter RNA virus may affect SARS-CoV-2 virulence and transmissibility and facilitate global spread, similar to what happened with D614G mutation [21].\n",
      "\n",
      "4|The ultimate strategy to effectively prevent COVID-19 is vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Recently approved vaccines, including mRNA-based vaccines, have shown great promise in terms of safety/efficacy profile [22, 23]. Luckily, anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are already being distributed worldwide, and transplant recipients have initiated vaccination in multiple locations with major variability in timing driven by government policies and availability of vaccines. Although data in transplant patients are limited, it is reasonable to think, based on data with other vaccines [24], that their immune responses will be protective, although the degree of protection and its duration are still unknown.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Strategies to prevent infection in transplant recipients are still important while vaccine is being delivered, in particular the use of masks and avoidance of crowded nonventilated spaces. The COVID-19 outbreak has seriously challenged the transplant practice worldwide. Innovative telehealth solutions have emerged allowing safe and efficient outpatient care, delineating the future transplant practice in the post-COVID-19 era. As the pandemic continues and new, more infectious variants of the virus emerge, identification of risk factors for infection may allow to risk stratify patients and tailor prevention strategies and prioritize vaccination in patients at highest risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The early decision to postpone nonurgent transplant programs has been accompanied by a drastic drop of organ procurement around the world. Such position has been questioned by the risk of mortality on the waiting list, and huge efforts have been made to settle efficient mitigating strategies to overcome these ethical issues\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Ideal strategies still have to be defined, and risk/benefit assessment should be discussed on a case-by-case basis within the transplant team. Even more uncertain is the management of immunosuppression and how it affects the risk of infection, mortality, and, possibly, response to vaccination\n",
      "\n",
      "1|This might be very important, as preliminary data among 436 transplant recipients that received either BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) or the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) suggest that the antibody immunity may be lower than in the general population, as evident by only 17% detection of antibody against the spike antigen after first dose of the vaccine [25].\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The need for remote monitoring of graft function has further highlighted the importance of noninvasive biomarkers of acute rejection. Despite the approval by the Food and Drug Administration of a few assays, this still largely represents an unmet need that should also be adequately addressed in the post-COVID-19 period of transplant medicine.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Optimal protection of kidney transplant recipients during COVID-19 outbreak is an evolving concept, and more studies are required to understand special needs of this fragile population. Through an extremely challenging path, this pandemic forced the transplant community to revisit strategies and priorities. Once the viral spread will be under control, these challenges may ultimately result in a better care of transplanted individuals.\n",

      "2|Background: Currently, a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is underway, resulting in high morbidity and mortality across the globe. Summary: A prompt and effective diagnosis is crucial to identify infected individuals, to monitor the infection, to perform contact tracing, and to limit the spread of the virus\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Since the announcement of this public health emergency, several diagnostic methods have been developed including molecular and serological assays, and more recently biosensors. Here, we present the use of these assays as well as their main technical features, advantages, and limits\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Key Messages: The development of reliable diagnostic assays is crucial not only for a correct diagnosis and containment of COVID-19 pandemic, but also for the decision-making process that is behind the clinical decisions, eventually contributing to the improvement of patient management. Furthermore, with the advent of vaccine and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, serological assays will be instrumental for the validation of these new therapeutic options.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|An outbreak of unknown pneumonia was reported at the end of December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. From the respiratory secretions of affected patients was isolated, a novel coronavirus whose genome analysis indicated belonging to the genus β-coronavirus, lineage B, subgenus Sarbecovirus\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This seventh human coronavirus is related to some severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses detected in bats, but it is distinct from the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [1]. The new coronavirus was named SARS-CoV-2\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Since its discovery, SARS-CoV-2 spread all over the world, and at the time of writing >85 million people are infected and almost 2 million died (January 3, 2021). Exposure to the virus may result in asymptomatic infection or development of symptoms that may range from mild upper respiratory tract symptoms to severe pneumonia with respiratory failure, hypercoagulation, hyperinflammatory manifestations, and eventually death because of multiple organ failure [2, 3]\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In Italy, according to the report released by Istituto Superiore Sanità updated to December 2, 2020 (https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/sars-cov-2-decessi-italia), the mean age of patients dying for SARS-CoV-2 infection is 80 years, most deaths occur in men, and 63.1% of deceased men positive to SARS-CoV-2 suffers from 3 or more comorbidities. Among these, the most common are hypertension (64.2%), type 2 diabetes (30.7%), and ischemic heart disease (30.7%)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In order to contain the pandemic, an effective and rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 suspected infection is required. Several diagnostics methods have been developed in a short time frame since the beginning of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic including molecular and serological assays [4], and more recently very innovative methods such as biosensors which are currently under investigation and require validation [5, 6].\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Currently, real-time PCR is the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 testing or for confirming COVID-19 diagnosis. However, it requires skilled personnel and time-consuming laboratory procedures\n",
      "\n",
      "2|For this reason, the development of innovative approaches such as biosensors is welcome. They could facilitate the control of outbreaks allowing for a diagnosis of infection at earlier stages thus reducing the rate of transmission, morbidity, and mortality\n",
      "\n",
      "1|In this review, we address the use of these diagnostic assays, underlying their advantages and limits, and reporting on their main technical features.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Several molecular assays have been validated and are currently available on the market for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Validated specimen types include nasopharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal aspirate, oropharyngeal swab, bronchoalveolar lavage, and sputum [7]. More recently, saliva has also been evaluated but awaits validation. Preliminary results indicate saliva as a promising biological specimen for diagnosis, monitoring, and infection control [8].\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections are confirmed after detection of unique and specific target regions within the viral genome. According to the PCR design, the specific target regions may include ORF1ab, RdRp, N, and S genes. In addition, some commercial assays include also the amplification of the common beta coronavirus E gene, which is amplified along with one or more specific target genes. In Table 1 are reported the molecular assays approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (0011715-03/04/2020-DGPRE-DGPRE-P).\n",
      "\n",
      "3|In the USA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a real-time PCR protocol, which targets 2 regions of the N gene of SARS-CoV-2. The internal control is represented by the human RNase P gene that is detected both in clinical specimens and control samples (https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download. Revision 3, March 30, 2020).\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Real-time PCR assays represent the gold standard for the laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, false-negative results may occur. Several factors may be responsible for these incorrect results: quality of the specimen, viral load below the limit of detection (LOD) of the method, incorrect handling of the specimen, problems during shipment, timing of sampling (sample collected too early or too late during infection), and source of sample (upper or lower respiratory tract). In the initial phase of COVID-19 disease, upper respiratory tract sample can result in RT-PCR negative, while chest computed tomography images show the presence of pulmonary abnormalities consistent with viral pneumonia [9-11]. Repeat testing can increase the chance of detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA [12].\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Point of care (POC) molecular tests are designed to deliver results in <1 h using RT-PCR technology and are performed on individuals with suspected COVID-19. They do not require particularly trained personnel; hands-on time is minimal (∼1–2 min), and thier result interpretation is straightforward. POC assays may facilitate the management and triage of patients, and some of these platforms could be used outside hospital settings such as in nursing homes to screen the elderly population, which is at high risk of developing pneumonia with consequences often fatal. In Table 2 are listed some of the rapid molecular tests that can be used for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in individuals with signs and symptoms of suspected COVID-19.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Although correlations have been done between viral load and severity of disease [13], Ct values cannot be used to assess disease’s severity or to monitor response to therapy yet. However, low Ct values, indicative of high viral loads, may be used to indicate transmissibility [14, 15]\n",
      "\n",
      "2|SHERLOCK (Specific High-sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter unLOCKing) assay combines simplified viral RNA extraction with isothermal amplification and CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)-mediated detection. The assay was designed to detect the N gene of SARS-CoV-2 by optimized sets of LAMP (Loop-mediated isothermal AMPlification) primers and AapCas12b guide RNA\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The assay is highly sensitive (33 copies/mL vs. 1,000 copies/mL of the CDC qRT-PCR), and the results can be read on a lateral-flow strip or fluorescence reader after 80 or 45 min, respectively [16]\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Similarly, DETECRT (SARS-CoV-2 DNA Endonuclease-TargEted CRISPR Trans Reporter) assay performs reverse transcription and isothermal amplification of RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs, followed by Cas12-based detection of E and N gene sequences. The N sequence targeted by DETECTR differs from that recognized by the CDC assay (N1 and N3 regions)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The selected Cas12 guide RNAs allows the identification of SARS-CoV-2, bat SARS-like coronavirus and SARS-CoV in the E gene, whereas the N region is specific for SARS-CoV-2. The test is positive if both the E and N genes are detected or presumptive positive if either E or N gene is detected\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The LOD of the assay is 10 copies/µL reaction versus 1 copy/µL of the CDC assay. The positive predictive agreement and negative predictive agreement of DETECTR assay versus CDC qRT-PCR are 95 and 100%, respectively\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The turn-around time of the DETECTR assay from extraction to result is about 52 min for 1–8 samples extracted manually. Results are visualized by a fluorescent reader or lateral flow strip [17].\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Serological assays have been developed using as target the highly antigenic structural proteins spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) of SARS-CoV-2. In most individuals, measurable antibodies develop within days or weeks from symptoms onset [18, 19], thus limiting the use of serological testing in the early phase of infection [20, 21]. However, serological assays are important for contact tracing, for identifying suspected cases who are PCR negative but show radiological findings suggestive of CO­VID-19 [9, 10], to identify asymptomatic carriers [22] or to determine the development of neutralizing antibodies in response to vaccination [23, 24]. Instead, doubts arise about the use of antibody tests for seroprevalence surveys for public health management reasons because the duration of circulating antibody is currently unknown [25].\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Most of the available serological assays detect IgM and IgG antibodies although IgA antibodies play an important role in mucosal immunity. IgAs can be detected earlier than IgGs, and in atypical cases or in patients with repeated negative RT-PCR, IgA along with IgG may contribute to the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection [26].\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Several commercial serological assays have been developed since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic such as ELISAs, chemiluminescence assays (CLIAs), and lateral flow assays. Because of the differences in the assay design, immunoglobulin classes detected (IgM, IgG, and IgA), SARS-CoV-2 antigen used (receptor binding domain [RBD], S protein, S1 subunit, N protein) or native inactivated SARS-CoV-2 [27], and specimen type (serum, plasma, whole blood, and finger-stick whole blood) results are often not comparable. Furthermore, it is important to verify the performance characteristics of the assays through a validation process that takes into account the analytical features of the assay as well as the clinical sensitivity of the test results [28].\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Serological assays can be qualitative or semiquantitative and show different sensitivity and specificity toward the antibodies detected. In a recent study where was compared the performance of ELISA, CLIA, and ECLIA assays, it was found that overall, the ECLIA assay performed best showing an optimal sensitivity and specificity since the first days of infection suggesting that it could be considered a valid screening method\n",
      "\n",
      "2|IgAs were detected earlier than IgMs by ELISA assay suggesting that IgA detection can be more useful than IgM in the early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, its level was higher than IgM over 20 days of observation [29]\n",
      "\n",
      "2|A similar observation was already reported in literature [30]. Instead, IgGs were consistently detected after 10 days from symptoms onset in line with other studies [29, 31].\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Magnetic chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay is a double antibody sandwich immunoassay that uses the nucleoprotein and a peptide of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 as recombinant antigens for the detection of IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Using this assay, IgM and IgG were detected since the first days after symptoms onset, and by 17–19 days from symptoms onset, 100% of the study subjects were IgG positive\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The subject’s IgM positive reached a peak of 94.1% after 20–22 days from symptoms onset. The median day of seroconversion for both IgM and IgG was 13 days post symptoms onset\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Three types of seroconversion were observed: (i) synchronous seroconversion of IgM and IgG; (ii) IgM seroconversion earlier than IgG; and (iii) IgG seroconversion earlier than IgM. In some patients, IgM and IgG plateaued 6 days after the first positive determination\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Furthermore, testing of the sera of individuals with negative RT-PCR and no symptoms who came in close contacts with COVID-19 patients showed that some of these individuals later tested IgM and/or IgG positive. These last cases demonstrate the importance of serology in identifying those suspected cases that are missed by molecular tests [32].\n",
      "\n",
      "3|With the introduction of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, it will be important to monitor the development of neutralizing antibodies against the virus and their duration. At the time of writing, the vaccine Comirnaty developed by Pfizer-BioNTech against SARS-CoV-2 has received both the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicine Agency approval (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine|FDA; European Medicine Agency recommends first COVID-19 vaccine for authorization in the EU|European Medicines Agency [europa.eu]), and the approval for the AIFA (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco), and is being distributed in Italy. This vaccine demonstrated a 95% efficacy in clinical trial in people 16 years of age or older [33].\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Recently, an immunoassay, Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Roche Diagnostics, Monza, Italy), has been released which is designed for the quantitative determination of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD in human serum and plasma. The assay uses a recombinant RBD of the S antigen in a double-antigen sandwich assay format that favors detection of high-affinity antibodies against SARS-CoV-2\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The assay aims at evaluating the adaptive humoral immune response to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 [34]. This assay showed a clinical sensitivity of 98.8% (95% CI: 98.1–99.3%) when testing samples collected 14 days or later after confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis by PCR, and an analytical specificity of 100% (95% CI: 99.7–100%) when testing samples collected before October 2019, including samples from individuals with common cold symptoms, samples from individuals infected with 1 of the 4 common cold coronaviruses (HKU1, NL63, 229E, or OC43), and anti-MERS-CoV positive samples\n",
      "\n",
      "1|The clinical specificity was 99.98% (95% CI: 99.91–100%), when testing pre-pandemic samples obtained from routine diagnostics and blood donors (Roche Diagnostics International Ltd, Rotkreuz, Switzerland).\n",
      "\n",
      "3|There are 2 types of rapid diagnostic assays: the antigen detection assay and the antibody detection assay. Both tests can be used at the POC or near it and do not require special equipment or laboratory infrastructures. They are particularly useful in settings where more expensive equipment or reagents are not available or when it is necessary to reduce the pressure on the molecular biology laboratories [35].\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The antigen detection assay is usually directed against the nucleocapsid protein of the SARS-CoV-2 which is produced during active infection. The assay is performed on nasopharyngeal swab samples that are released into a dedicated or universal transport medium\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The result of the antigen detection assay may be influenced by several factors including the time of sample collection, the quality of sampling, the concentration of the virus in the collected sample, and the quality of the reagents. The sensitivity of the assay is low compared to molecular tests [36], and it is generally positive when the viral load is very high and the subject is very infectious, that is, in the first days of infection during the asymptomatic phase (1–2 days) and few days after symptoms onset (5–7 days)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The antigen test is usually negative when the Ct value of the real-time PCR is over 30, while its sensitivity increases with Ct values below 25 [36]. Therefore, a negative antigen test result cannot exclude a SARS-CoV-2 infection, and cannot be used to provide guidance for quarantine decision\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Nonetheless, rapid antigen tests may be useful in high prevalence settings, where a positive result most likely represents a true positive result or in the presence of asymptomatic carriers with high viral load where accelerates contact tracing [37]. Time to result is about 15 min.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Rapid antibody tests are easy to perform and can be used at the POC returning a result within 15–20 min. The test can be run on whole blood, finger-stick whole blood, serum, and plasma. Rapid antibody tests can be used to detect previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used for determining active infections in clinical care or for contact-tracing purposes. A positive result does not necessarily reflect the presence of neutralizing antibodies or protective immunity [38].\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Rapid antibody tests are not useful for the early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall, antibody tests have an accuracy of 30% in the first week after symptoms onset, that increases to 70% in the second week, and to >90% after 3 weeks [25]\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Sensitivities, specificity, and accuracy vary with the manufacturer. For instance, in a study performed in our laboratory, rapid tests were compared to CLIA assay\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The following results were obtained: CLIA assay showed a sensitivity of 95% for IgG versus about 90% for the immunochromatographic tests, whereas the sensitivity for IgM was 91% for CLIA and ranged from 61.4 to 87.8% for the rapid tests. Specificity was 100% for all tests [39]\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Therefore, these tests should undergo laboratory validation before use in outpatient clinics or as direct-to-consumer testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|A rapid and accurate, easy to use, diagnostic system is important for controlling infection source and monitoring progression of disease. Recently, it has been developed an ultrasensitive electrochemical detection technology that uses calixarene functionalized graphene oxide for targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Using a portable electrochemical smartphone, this technology can detect viral RNA without performing reverse transcription and amplification, but instead, it relies on a supersandwich-type recognition approach. The biosensor detected viral RNA from COVID-19 confirmed patients and recovery patients, and the detectable ratio was higher than RT-PCR suggesting a higher sensitivity\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In this work, the authors reached a LOD of 200 copies/mL which is much lower than the LODs claimed by several commercial diagnostic RT-PCR assays. Given the high sensitivity and easy to use, the biosensor could be used as a point-of-care (POC) testing [5].\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Another interesting approach is the use of a breath device for differentiating between COVID-19 patients and patients with other lung infections. The device is composed of a nanomaterial-based hybrid sensor array able to detect disease-specific biomarkers from exhaled breath [6]\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, this biosensor showed a good capability of differentiating between COVID-19 patients, healthy controls, and patients with lung infections unrelated to COVID-19. Training and test set data showed 94 and 76% accuracy in differentiating patients from controls, and 90 and 95% accuracy in differentiating between COVID-19 patients and patients with other lung infections, respectively [6]\n",
      "\n",
      "1|If the validity of this technology is confirmed by future studies, this biosensor may be used as screening tool in POC facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Laboratory diagnostic assays are key for a proper management of COVID-19 patients and for limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Molecular assays represent the gold standard for the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 cases\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Nonetheless, serological assays may be used in combination with molecular tests to improve diagnostic sensitivity and to identify asymptomatic individuals who tested PCR negative but are IgG or IgM positive; in particular close contacts of COVID-19 patients. With the introduction of the prophylactic vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, detection and quantification of neutralizing antibodies by serological assays will allow to verify the efficacy of the vaccine through the determination of the antibody response against the virus and to monitor the neutralizing antibody titer\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Monitoring of the antibody titer is important to determine when a new dose of vaccine is needed. Finally, a new impulse in support of the battle against COVID-19 pandemic comes from new technologies such as biosensors that, if validated, might be used in POC facilities.\n",

      "4|Geography is the study of places and the relationships between people and their environments. Geographers explore both the physical properties of Earth’s surface and the human societies spread across it. They also examine how human culture interacts with the natural environment, and the way that locations and places can have an impact on people. Geography seeks to understand where things are found, why they are there, and how they develop and change over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The term \"geography\" comes to us from the ancient Greeks, who needed a word to describe the writings and maps that were helping them make sense of the world in which they lived. In Greek, geo means “earth” and -graphy means “to write.” Using geography, Greeks developed an understanding of where their homeland was located in relation to other places, what their own and other places were like, and how people and environments were distributed. These concerns have been central to geography ever since.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Of course, the Greeks were not the only people interested in geography. Throughout human history, most societies have sought to understand something about their place in the world, and the people and environments around them.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Indeed, mapmaking probably came even before writing in many places. But ancient Greek geographers were particularly influential\n",
      "\n",
      "2|They developed very detailed maps of areas in and around Greece, including parts of Europe, Africa, and Asia. More importantly, they also raised questions about how and why different human and natural patterns came into being on Earth’s surface, and why variations existed from place to place\n",
      "\n",
      "1|The effort to answer these questions about patterns and distribution led them to figure out that the world was round, to calculate Earth’s circumference, and to develop explanations of everything from the seasonal flooding of the Nile River to differences in population densities from place to place.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|During the Middle Ages, geography ceased to be a major academic pursuit in Europe. Advances in geography were chiefly made by scientists of the Muslim world, based around the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa. Geographers of this Islamic Golden Age created the world’s first rectangular map based on a grid, a map system that is still familiar today. Islamic scholars also applied their study of people and places to agriculture, determining which crops and livestock were most suited to specific habitats or environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In addition to the advances in the Middle East, the Chinese empire in Asia also contributed immensely to geography. Until about 1500, China was the most prosperous civilization on Earth\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The Chinese were scientifically advanced, especially in the field of astronomy. Around 1000, they also achieved one of the most important developments in the history of geography: They were the first to use the compass for navigational purposes\n",

      "\n",
      "3|Through the 13th-century travels of the Italian explorer Marco Polo, Europeans learned about the riches of China. Curiosity was awakened; a desire to trade with wealthy Asian cultures motivated a renewed interest in exploring the world. The period of time between the 15th and 17th centuries is known in the West as the Age of Exploration or the Age of Discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|With the dawn of the Age of Discovery, the study of geography regained popularity in Europe. The invention of the printing press in the mid-1400s helped spread geographic knowledge by making maps and charts widely available. Improvements in shipbuilding and navigation facilitated more exploring, greatly improving the accuracy of maps and geographic information.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Greater geographic understanding allowed European powers to extend their global influence. During the Age of Discovery, European nations established colonies around the world. Improved transportation, communication, and navigational technology allowed countries such as the United Kingdom to successfully govern colonies as far away as the Americas, Asia, Australia, and Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Geography was not just a subject that made colonialism possible, however. It also helped people understand the planet on which they lived. Not surprisingly, geography became an important focus of study in schools and universities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Geography also became an important part of other academic disciplines, such as chemistry, economics, and philosophy. In fact, every academic subject has some geographic connection\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Chemists study where certain chemical elements, such as gold or silver, can be found. Economists examine which nations trade with other nations, and what resources are exchanged\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Philosophers analyze the responsibility people have to take care of the Earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Some people have trouble understanding the complete scope of the discipline of geography because, unlike most other disciplines, geography is not defined by one particular topic. Instead, geography is concerned with many different topics—people, culture, politics, settlements, plants, landforms, and much more.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|What distinguishes geography is that it approaches the study of diverse topics in a particular way (that is, from a particular perspective). Geography asks spatial questions—how and why things are distributed or arranged in particular ways on Earth’s surface. It looks at these different distributions and arrangements at many different scales. It also asks questions about how the interaction of different human and natural activities on Earth’s surface shape the characteristics of the world in which we live.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Geography seeks to understand where things are found and why they are present in those places; how things that are located in the same or distant places influence one another over time; and why places and the people who live in them develop and change in particular ways. Raising these questions is at the heart of the “geographic perspective.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Exploration has long been an important part of geography. But exploration no longer simply means going to places that have not been visited before. It means documenting and trying to explain the variations that exist across the surface of Earth, as well as figuring out what those variations mean for the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The age-old practice of mapping still plays an important role in this type of exploration, but exploration can also be done by using images from satellites or gathering information from interviews. Discoveries can come by using computers to map and analyze the relationship among things in geographic space, or from piecing together the multiple forces, near and far, that shape the way individual places develop.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The insights that have come from geographic research show the importance of asking “the why of where” questions. Geographic studies comparing physical characteristics of continents on either side of the Atlantic Ocean, for instance, gave rise to the idea that Earth’s surface is comprised of large, slowly moving plates—plate tectonics.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Studies of the geographic distribution of human settlements have shown how economic forces and modes of transport influence the location of towns and cities. For example, geographic analysis has pointed to the role of the U.S\n",

      "\n",
      "2|John Snow’s cholera map stands out as a classic example. When cholera broke out in London, England, in 1854, Snow represented the deaths per household on a street map\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Using the map, he was able to trace the source of the outbreak to a water pump on the corner of Broad Street and Cambridge Street. The geographic perspective helped identify the source of the problem (the water from a specific pump) and allowed people to avoid the disease (avoiding water from that pump).\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Investigations of the geographic impact of human activities have advanced understanding of the role of humans in transforming the surface of Earth, exposing the spatial extent of threats such as water pollution by manmade waste. For example, geographic study has shown that a large mass of tiny pieces of plastic currently floating in the Pacific Ocean is approximately the size of Texas. Satellite images and other geographic technology identified the so-called “Great Pacific Garbage Patch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Because the study of geography is so broad, the discipline is typically divided into specialties. At the broadest level, geography is divided into physical geography, human geography, geographic techniques, and regional geography.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The natural environment is the primary concern of physical geographers, although many physical geographers also look at how humans have altered natural systems. Physical geographers study Earth’s seasons, climate, atmosphere, soil, streams, landforms, and oceans. Some disciplines within physical geography include geomorphology, glaciology, pedology, hydrology, climatology, biogeography, and oceanography.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Geomorphology is the study of landforms and the processes that shape them. Geomorphologists investigate the nature and impact of wind, ice, rivers, erosion, earthquakes, volcanoes, living things, and other forces that shape and change the surface of the Earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Glaciologists focus on the Earth’s ice fields and their impact on the planet’s climate. Glaciologists document the properties and distribution of glaciers and icebergs. Data collected by glaciologists has demonstrated the retreat of Arctic and Antarctic ice in the past century.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Pedologists study soil and how it is created, changed, and classified. Soil studies are used by a variety of professions, from farmers analyzing field fertility to engineers investigating the suitability of different areas for building heavy structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Hydrology is the study of Earth’s water: its properties, distribution, and effects. Hydrologists are especially concerned with the movement of water as it cycles from the ocean to the atmosphere, then back to Earth’s surface. Hydrologists study the water cycle through rainfall into streams, lakes, the soil, and underground aquifers. Hydrologists provide insights that are critical to building or removing dams, designing irrigation systems, monitoring water quality, tracking drought conditions, and predicting flood risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Climatologists study Earth’s climate system and its impact on Earth’s surface. For example, climatologists make predictions about El Nino, a cyclical weather phenomenon of warm surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. They analyze the dramatic worldwide climate changes caused by El Nino, such as flooding in Peru, drought in Australia, and, in the United States, the oddities of heavy Texas rains or an unseasonably warm Minnesota winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Biogeographers study the impact of the environment on the distribution of plants and animals. For example, a biogeographer might document all the places in the world inhabited by a certain spider species, and what those places have in common.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Oceanography, a related discipline of physical geography, focuses on the creatures and environments of the world’s oceans. Observation of ocean tides and currents constituted some of the first oceanographic investigations. For example, 18th-century mariners figured out the geography of the Gulf Stream, a massive current flowing like a river through the Atlantic Ocean. The discovery and tracking of the Gulf Stream helped communications and travel between Europe and the Americas.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Human geography is concerned with the distribution and networks of people and cultures on Earth’s surface. A human geographer might investigate the local, regional, and global impact of rising economic powers China and India, which represent 37 percent of the world’s people. They also might look at how consumers in China and India adjust to new technology and markets, and how markets respond to such a huge consumer base.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Human geographers also study how people use and alter their environments. When, for example, people allow their animals to overgraze a region, the soil erodes and grassland is transformed into desert. The impact of overgrazing on the landscape as well as agricultural production is an area of study for human geographers.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Finally, human geographers study how political, social, and economic systems are organized across geographical space. These include governments, religious organizations, and trade partnerships. The boundaries of these groups constantly change.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|The main divisions within human geography reflect a concern with different types of human activities or ways of living. Some examples of human geography include urban geography, economic geography, cultural geography, political geography, social geography, and population geography. Human geographers who study geographic patterns and processes in past times are part of the subdiscipline of historical geography. Those who study how people understand maps and geographic space belong to a subdiscipline known as behavioral geography.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Cultural geographers study how the natural environment influences the development of human culture, such as how the climate affects the agricultural practices of a region. Political geographers study the impact of political circumstances on interactions between people and their environment, as well as environmental conflicts, such as disputes over water rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Some human geographers focus on the connection between human health and geography. For example, health geographers create maps that track the location and spread of specific diseases. They analyze the geographic disparities of health-care access. They are very interested in the impact of the environment on human health, especially the effects of environmental hazards such as radiation, lead poisoning, or water pollution.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Specialists in geographic techniques study the ways in which geographic processes can be analyzed and represented using different methods and technologies. Mapmaking, or cartography, is perhaps the most basic of these. Cartography has been instrumental to geography throughout the ages.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|As early as 1500 BCE, Polynesian navigators in the Pacific Ocean used complex maps made of tiny sticks and shells that represented islands and ocean currents they would encounter on their voyages. Today, satellites placed into orbit by the U.S. Department of Defense communicate with receivers on the ground called global positioning system (GPS) units to instantly identify exact locations on Earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Today, almost the entire surface of Earth has been mapped with remarkable accuracy, and much of this information is available instantly on the internet. One of the most remarkable of these websites is Google Earth, which “lets you fly anywhere on Earth to view satellite imagery, maps, terrain, 3D buildings, from galaxies in outer space to the canyons of the ocean.” In essence, anyone can be a virtual Christopher Columbus from the comfort of home.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Technological developments during the past 100 years have given rise to a number of other specialties for scientists studying geographic techniques. The airplane made it possible to photograph land from above. Now, there are many satellites and other above-Earth vehicles that help geographers figure out what the surface of the planet looks like and how it is changing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Geographers looking at what above-Earth cameras and sensors reveal are specialists in remote sensing. Pictures taken from space can be used to make maps, monitor ice melt, assess flood damage, track oil spills, predict weather, or perform endless other functions\n",
      "\n",
      "2|For example, by comparing satellite photos taken from 1955 to 2007, scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) discovered that the rate of coastal erosion along Alaska’s Beaufort Sea had doubled\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Every year from 2002 to 2007, about 45 feet per year of coast, mostly icy permafrost, vanished into the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Computerized systems that allow for precise calculations of how things are distributed and relate to one another have made the study of geographic information systems (GIS) an increasingly important specialty within geography. Geographic information systems are powerful databases that collect all types of information (maps, reports, statistics, satellite images, surveys, demographic data, and more) and link each piece of data to a geographic reference point, such as geographic coordinates. This data, called geospatial information, can be stored, analyzed, modeled, and manipulated in ways not possible before GIS computer technology existed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The popularity and importance of GIS has given rise to a new science known as geographic information science (GISci). Geographic information scientists study patterns in nature as well as human development\n",
      "\n",
      "2|They might study natural hazards, such as a fire that struck Los Angeles, California, in 2008. A map posted on the internet showed the real-time spread of the fire, along with information to help people make decisions about how to evacuate quickly\n",
      "\n",
      "1|GIS can also illustrate human struggles from a geographic perspective, such as the interactive online map published by the New York Times in May 2009 that showed building foreclosure rates in various regions around the New York City area.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The enormous possibilities for producing computerized maps and diagrams that can help us understand environmental and social problems have made geographic visualization an increasingly important specialty within geography. This geospatial information is in high demand by just about every institution, from government agencies monitoring water quality to entrepreneurs deciding where to locate new businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Regional geographers take a somewhat different approach to specialization, directing their attention to the general geographic characteristics of a region. A regional geographer might specialize in African studies, observing and documenting the people, nations, rivers, mountains, deserts, weather, trade, and other attributes of the continent\n",
      "\n",
      "2|There are different ways you can define a region. You can look at climate zones, cultural regions, or political regions\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Often regional geographers have a physical or human geography specialty as well as a regional specialty.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Regional geographers may also study smaller regions, such as urban areas. A regional geographer may be interested in the way a city like Shanghai, China, is growing. They would study transportation, migration, housing, and language use, as well as the human impact on elements of the natural environment, such as the Huangpu River.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Whether geography is thought of as a discipline or as a basic feature of our world, developing an understanding of the subject is important. Some grasp of geography is essential as people seek to make sense of the world and understand their place in it. Thinking geographically helps people to be aware of the connections among and between places and to see how important events are shaped by where they take place. Finally, knowing something about geography enriches people’s lives—promoting curiosity about other people and places and an appreciation of the patterns, environments, and peoples that make up the endlessly fascinating, varied planet on which we live.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|A global survey of fossil pollen has discovered that the planet's vegetation is changing at least as quickly today as it did when the last ice sheets retreated around 10,000 years ago. Beginning some 3,000-to-4,000 years ago, Earth's plant communities began changing at an accelerating pace. Today, this pace rivals or exceeds the rapid turnover that took place as plants raced to colonize formerly frozen landscapes and adapt to a global climate that warmed by about 10 degrees Fahrenheit.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This work also suggests ecosystem rates of change will continue to accelerate over the coming decades, as modern climate change further adds to this long history of flux. And by showing that recent biodiversity trends are the start of a longer-term acceleration in ecosystem transformations, the new study provides context for other recent reports that global biodiversity changes have accelerated over the last century.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|An international collaboration of scientists led the new analysis, which was powered by an innovative database for paleoecological data. The Neotoma Paleoecology Database is an open-access tool that gathers and curates data on past ecosystems from hundreds of scientists. Neotoma is chaired by University of Wisconsin-Madison professor of geography Jack Williams, who helped lead the new research.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|\"At the end of the ice age, we had complete, biome-scale ecosystem conversions,\" says Williams, who also curates Neotoma's North American pollen database. \"And over the past few thousand years, we're at that scale again. It has changed that much. And these changes began earlier than we might have thought before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Fossil pollen provides an extremely sensitive measure of past plant communities. As pollen from surrounding plants falls into lakes, it settles in layers from oldest at the bottom to newest at the top. Scientists can extract sediment cores and conduct the painstaking work of identifying pollen and reconstructing plant ecosystems over thousands of years.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Yet each sediment core only provides information about one place on Earth, so true global-scale analyses of past vegetation change require the amassing and curating of many such records. Neotoma has gathered thousands of such datapoints to help scientists uncover global trends. Researchers from the University of Bergen in Norway, UW-Madison, and Neotoma data stewards from around the world collaborated to perform the new analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|They discovered that the rate of change initially peaked between 8,000 and 16,000 years ago, depending on the continent. These continental differences are likely caused by different timing and patterns of climate change linked to retreating glaciers, rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, changes in Earth's orbit, and changes in ocean and atmospheric circulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Ecosystems then stabilized until about 4,000 years ago. Then, the rate of change began a meteoric rise that continues today, when most plant ecosystems are changing at least as fast as they did at the peak of ice-age-induced flux.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Scientists have coined the term the Anthropocene to describe the modern geological period, when humans are the dominant influence on the world. \"And one of the questions has been, when did the Anthropocene begin?\" says Williams. \"This work suggests that 3,000 to 4,000 years ago, humans were already having an enormous impact on the world (and) that continues today.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3|A sobering implication from this work, say the scientists, is that in the past, the periods of ecosystem transformations driven by climate change and those driven by land use were largely separate. But now, intensified land use continues, and the world is warming at an increasing rate due to the accumulation of greenhouse gases. As plant communities respond to the combination of direct human impacts and human-induced climate change, future rates of ecosystem transformation may break new records yet again.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Chiang, who earned her Ph.D. in 2020 and is now a postdoctoral scholar at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, said that her team's research demonstrated significant shifts in drought characteristics -- frequency, duration and intensity -- due to human influence, or what they call \"anthropogenic forcing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The modeling experiments under natural-only conditions did not show regional changes in drought characteristics from the late 19th to late 20th centuries, according to the study. But when the team accounted for anthropogenic greenhouse gas and aerosol contributions, statistically significant increases occurred in drought hotspots in southern Europe, Central and South America, western and southern Africa and eastern Asia.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The team found that in examining the anthropogenic forcings separately, greenhouse gases had a bigger impact in the Mediterranean, Central America, the Amazon and southern Africa, while anthropogenic aerosols played a larger role in Northern Hemisphere monsoonal and sub-arctic regions. Chiang said human-emitted aerosols are essentially particulate matter that are small enough to be suspended in the air. They can come from power plants, car exhaust and biomass burning (fires to clear land or to burn farm waste).\n",
      "\n",
      "2|\"Knowing where, how and why droughts have been worsening around the world is important, because these events directly and indirectly impact everything from wildlife habitats to agricultural production to our economy,\" said co-author Amir AghaKouchak, UCI professor of civil & environmental engineering and Earth system science. \"Lengthy dry spells can even hamper the energy sector through disruptions to solar thermal, geothermal and hydropower generation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Co-author Omid Mazdiyasni, who earned a Ph.D. in civil & environmental engineering at UCI in 2020 and is now a project scientist with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works, said, \"To make matters worse, droughts can be accompanied by heat waves, and high heat and low moisture can increase wildfire risk, which is already significant in the western United States.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Biogeography is the study of the distribution of species and ecosystems in geographic space and through geological time. Organisms and biological communities often vary in a regular fashion along geographic gradients of latitude, elevation, isolation and habitat area\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Phytogeography is the branch of biogeography that studies the distribution of plants. Zoogeography is the branch that studies distribution of animals\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Mycogeography is the branch that studies distribution of fungi, such as mushrooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Knowledge of spatial variation in the numbers and types of organisms is as vital to us today as it was to our early human ancestors, as we adapt to heterogeneous but geographically predictable environments. Biogeography is an integrative field of inquiry that unites concepts and information from ecology, evolutionary biology, taxonomy, geology, physical geography, palaeontology, and climatology.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The short-term interactions within a habitat and species of organisms describe the ecological application of biogeography. Historical biogeography describes the long-term, evolutionary periods of time for broader classifications of organisms. Early scientists, beginning with Carl Linnaeus, contributed to the development of biogeography as a science.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The patterns of species distribution across geographical areas can usually be explained through a combination of historical factors such as: speciation, extinction, continental drift, and glaciation. Through observing the geographic distribution of species, we can see associated variations in sea level, river routes, habitat, and river capture. Additionally, this science considers the geographic constraints of landmass areas and isolation, as well as the available ecosystem energy supplies.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Over periods of ecological changes, biogeography includes the study of plant and animal species in: their past and/or present living refugium habitat; their interim living sites; and/or their survival locales. As writer David Quammen put it, \"...biogeography does more than ask Which species? and Where. It also asks Why? and, what is sometimes more crucial, Why not?.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Modern biogeography often employs the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), to understand the factors affecting organism distribution, and to predict future trends in organism distribution. Often mathematical models and GIS are employed to solve ecological problems that have a spatial aspect to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Biogeography is most keenly observed on the world's islands. These habitats are often much more manageable areas of study because they are more condensed than larger ecosystems on the mainland\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Islands are also ideal locations because they allow scientists to look at habitats that new invasive species have only recently colonized and can observe how they disperse throughout the island and change it. They can then apply their understanding to similar but more complex mainland habitats\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Islands are very diverse in their biomes, ranging from the tropical to arctic climates. This diversity in habitat allows for a wide range of species study in different parts of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|One scientist who recognized the importance of these geographic locations was Charles Darwin, who remarked in his journal \"The Zoology of Archipelagoes will be well worth examination\". Two chapters in On the Origin of Species were devoted to geographical distribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The first discoveries that contributed to the development of biogeography as a science began in the mid-18th century, as Europeans explored the world and described the biodiversity of life. During the 18th century most views on the world were shaped around religion and for many natural theologists, the bible\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Carl Linnaeus, in the mid-18th century, initiated the ways to classify organisms through his exploration of undiscovered territories. When he noticed that species were not as perpetual as he believed, he developed the Mountain Explanation to explain the distribution of biodiversity; when Noah's ark landed on Mount Ararat and the waters receded, the animals dispersed throughout different elevations on the mountain\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This showed different species in different climates proving species were not constant. Linnaeus' findings set a basis for ecological biogeography\n",
      "\n",

      "2|The practice of landscape architecture spread from the Old to the New World. The term \"landscape architect\" was used as a professional title by Frederick Law Olmsted in the United States in 1863 and Andrew Jackson Downing, another early American landscape designer, was editor of The Horticulturist magazine (1846–52)\n",

      "\n",
      "3|Landscape scientists have specialist skills such as soil science, hydrology, geomorphology or botany that they relate to the practical problems of landscape work. Their projects can range from site surveys to the ecological assessment of broad areas for planning or management purposes. They may also report on the impact of development or the importance of particular species in a given area.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Landscape planners are concerned with landscape planning for the location, scenic, ecological and recreational aspects of urban, rural, and coastal land use. Their work is embodied in written statements of policy and strategy, and their remit includes master planning for new developments, landscape evaluations and assessments, and preparing countryside management or policy plans. Some may also apply an additional specialism such as landscape archaeology or law to the process of landscape planning.\n",

Frederick Law Olmsted used the term 'landscape architecture' using the word as a profession for the first time when designing the Central Park\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Through the 19th century, urban planning became a focal point and central issue in cities. The combination of the tradition of landscape gardening and the emerging field of urban planning offered landscape architecture an opportunity to serve these needs\n",

      "4|The natural environment or natural world encompasses all living and non-living things occurring naturally, meaning in this case not artificial. The term is most often applied to the Earth or some parts of Earth. This environment encompasses the interaction of all living species, climate, weather and natural resources that affect human survival and economic activity. The concept of the natural environment can be distinguished as components:\n",
      "\n",
      "4|In contrast to the natural environment is the built environment. In such areas where humans have fundamentally transformed landscapes such as urban settings and agricultural land conversion, the natural environment is greatly changed into a simplified human environment. Even acts which seem less extreme, such as building a mud hut or a photovoltaic system in the desert, the modified environment becomes an artificial one. Though many animals build things to provide a better environment for themselves, they are not human, hence beaver dams, and the works of mound-building termites, are thought of as natural.\n",

      "3|People seldom find absolutely natural environments on Earth, and naturalness usually varies in a continuum, from 100% natural in one extreme to 0% natural in the other. More precisely, we can consider the different aspects or components of an environment, and see that their degree of naturalness is not uniform. If, for instance, in an agricultural field, the mineralogic composition and the structure of its soil are similar to those of an undisturbed forest soil, but the structure is quite different.\n",

      "1|The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the continents, various archipelagos, and other criteria: these divisions are (in descending order of size) the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Southern Ocean and the Arctic Ocean.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|A river is a natural watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. A few rivers simply flow into the ground and dry up completely without reaching another body of water.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The water in a river is usually in a channel, made up of a stream bed between banks. In larger rivers there is often also a wider floodplain shaped by waters over-topping the channel\n",

      "2|A lake (from Latin lacus) is a terrain feature, a body of water that is localized to the bottom of basin. A body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, is not part of an ocean, and is larger and deeper than a pond.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation. Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|A pond is a body of standing water, either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy\n",

      "\n",
      "3|Thermosphere: The top of the thermosphere is the bottom of the exosphere, called the exobase. Its height varies with solar activity and ranges from about 350–800 km (220–500 mi; 1,150,000–2,620,000 ft). The International Space Station orbits in this layer, between 320 and 380 km (200 and 240 mi).\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Mesosphere: The mesosphere extends from the stratopause to 80–85 km (50–53 mi; 262,000–279,000 ft). It is the layer where most meteors burn up upon entering the atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Stratosphere: The stratosphere extends from the tropopause to about 51 km (32 mi; 167,000 ft). The stratopause, which is the boundary between the stratosphere and mesosphere, typically is at 50 to 55 km (31 to 34 mi; 164,000 to 180,000 ft).\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Troposphere: The troposphere begins at the surface and extends to between 7 km (23,000 ft) at the poles and 17 km (56,000 ft) at the equator, with some variation due to weather. The troposphere is mostly heated by transfer of energy from the surface, so on average the lowest part of the troposphere is warmest and temperature decreases with altitude. The tropopause is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The ozone layer is contained within the stratosphere. It is mainly located in the lower portion of the stratosphere from about 15–35 km (9.3–21.7 mi; 49,000–115,000 ft), though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically. About 90% of the ozone in our atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The ionosphere, the part of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation, stretches from 50 to 1,000 km (31 to 621 mi; 160,000 to 3,280,000 ft) and typically overlaps both the exosphere and the thermosphere. It forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The homosphere and heterosphere: The homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. The upper part of the heterosphere is composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element.\n",

      "2|Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100\n",

      "2|Efforts have been increasingly focused on the mitigation of greenhouse gases that are causing climatic changes, on developing adaptative strategies to global warming, to assist humans, other animal, and plant species, ecosystems, regions and nations in adjusting to the effects of global warming. Some examples of recent collaboration to address climate change and global warming include:\n",
      "\n",
      "3|A significantly profound challenge is to identify the natural environmental dynamics in contrast to environmental changes not within natural variances. A common solution is to adapt a static view neglecting natural variances to exist. Methodologically, this view could be defended when looking at processes which change slowly and short time series, while the problem arrives when fast processes turns essential in the object of the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Climate looks at the statistics of temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, rainfall, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological elements in a given region over long periods of time. Weather, on the other hand, is the present condition of these same elements over periods up to two weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Climates can be classified according to the average and typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme is the one originally developed by Wladimir Köppen. The Thornthwaite system, in use since 1948, uses evapotranspiration as well as temperature and precipitation information to study animal species diversity and the potential impacts of climate changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Weather is a set of all the phenomena occurring in a given atmospheric area at a given time. Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather refers, generally, to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \"weather\" is understood to be the weather of Earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Weather occurs due to density (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics\n",

From this point of view, it is the wildness of a place that makes it a wilderness. The mere presence or activity of people does not disqualify an area from being \"wilderness.\" Many ecosystems that are, or have been, inhabited or influenced by activities of people may still be considered \"wild.\" This way of looking at wilderness includes areas within which natural processes operate without very noticeable human interference.\n",

      "4|Nations which have failed to deliver their Kyoto emissions reductions obligations can enter Emissions Trading to purchase CERs and ERUs to cover their treaty shortfalls. Nations and groups of nations can also create local emission reduction schemes which place mandatory carbon dioxide emission targets on entities within their national boundaries. If the rules of a scheme allow, the obligated entities may be able to cover all or some of any reduction shortfalls by purchasing CERs and ERUs through Emissions Trading. While local emissions reduction schemes have no status under the Kyoto Protocol itself, they play a prominent role in creating the demand for CERs and ERUs, stimulating Emissions Trading and setting a market price for emissions.\n",

The Chicago Climate Exchange is a voluntary yet legally binding cap-and-trade emission scheme whereby members commit to the capped emission reductions and must purchase allowances from other members or offset excess emissions. The OTC market does not involve a legally binding scheme and a wide array of buyers from the public and private spheres, as well as special events that want to go carbon neutral.

      "3|In September 2019 the French Parliament adopted a law on energy and climate which enshrines into French law the objective of carbon neutrality by 2050, in line with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. Carbon neutrality means reducing carbon emissions and balancing residual emissions by capture and storage. Achieving carbon neutrality in France by 2050 will require a drastic decrease in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 75%, as compared to 1990 levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|To ensure this target is met, the French government developed a “National Low Carbon Strategy”, which acts as a roadmap for implementing a low-emission transition in each sector of the economy. For example, GHG emissions from industry account for almost one fifth of emissions in France, equivalent to total GHG emissions of Romania, and, under the proposed sectoral plan, will be reduced by a quarter within the next ten years.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|France currently employs two main carbon pricing mechanisms. The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) has been in place since 2005 and covers 75% of French industrial emissions. In 2014, France introduced a carbon tax on fossil fuel consumption. The rate started out at 7 euros per tonne of CO 2 and now amounts to 45 euros per tonne.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|These increasingly stringent carbon pricing policies have taken place in a period of rising industrial energy costs, thereby generating concern about the impacts of such policies on the competitiveness of the French manufacturing sector. At first glance, such concern appears to be borne out by recent trends as real output and total employment in the sector decreased by 5% and 26% respectively, between 2001 and 2016.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|However, a recent OECD report, “The joint effects of energy prices and carbon taxes on environmental and economic performance: Evidence from the French manufacturing sector”, sheds light on this issue. The study is the first to estimate the impact of energy prices and carbon taxes on environmental and economic performance using data at firm and industry levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The paper combines firm-level data on energy use and carbon emissions from the French annual survey on energy consumption (EACEI) with firm-level financial and economic performance data from the census of the French fiscal authority. The dataset covers 8,000 French firms observed yearly over the course of fifteen years (2001 to 2016) and represents the entire manufacturing sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The first major finding of the study is that, at the firm level, a 10% increase in energy costs results in a 6% decline in energy use, a 9% decrease in carbon emissions, and a 2% decrease in the number of full-time employees within one year. However, these jobs are not lost, but are reallocated to other firms. At the industry level, the study finds no statistical link between energy prices and net job creation, indicating that jobs lost at affected firms are compensated by increases in employment in other firms operating in the same sector during the same year.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Second, these effects vary both between industries and according to the size of the firm and their energy intensity. For example, when facing the same increase in the energy cost, firms in the wearing apparel industry reduces their carbon emissions twice as much as firms producing non-metallic minerals. The reallocation of workers in the food products industry is half the reallocation in the basic metals industry. On average, large and energy intensive firms experience greater reduction in carbon emissions and greater job reallocation than smaller and energy efficient firms.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|With this, the paper is able to measure the causal effect of the carbon tax on the aggregate manufacturing sector since its introduction in 2014. Figure 1 plots the carbon tax on the left axis (green line) together with the impacts of the carbon tax on the French manufacturing sector’s jobs (purple line) and carbon emissions (red line) on the right axis. In five years, the carbon tax decreased carbon emissions by 5%. The net effect on employment is much smaller in magnitude and even slightly positive at +0.8%.\n",

      "2|Note: The graph shows the simulated impact of the carbon tax on the job reallocation and CO 2 emissions of the French manufacturing sector. Source: Dussaux (2020).\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Finally, the paper considers a scenario where the carbon tax is doubled from its current rate of 45 € per tonne of CO 2 . Figure 2 shows the simulated effect of the tax increase on job reallocations and carbon emissions for each manufacturing industry. These job reallocations are not net job losses, but the number of people forced to change jobs (within the same industry or between industries).\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Note: The graph shows the causal impact of an increase in the carbon tax from 44.6 € to 86.2 € per ton of CO 2 on the job reallocation and CO 2 emissions of French manufacturing industries. For clarity, the food products sector is not included.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|A simulated doubling of the carbon tax highlights significant heterogeneity across sectors. Several industries such as furniture, wood products, paper, and textiles experience large reductions in carbon emissions with little job reallocation. On the contrary, the motor vehicles and the plastic industries experience larger job reallocations and smaller declines in carbon emissions. Other industries such as metal products experience large job reallocation and emissions reduction because of their size.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Although the carbon tax enables the French manufacturing sector to meet its carbon budget anddoes not affect total employment negatively, it however generates non-negligible job reallocations in several industries. Because these reallocation effects have redistributive implications and generate costs for workers who are forced to change jobs, these results call for complementary labour market policies that minimise those costs on affected workers and ease between-firms adjustments in employment. Moreover, since these transition costs are typically highly localised in regions specialised in polluting activities, they can also translate into potentially significant regional effects and thus political costs.\n",

      "2|We have built our economies on the premise that land is a primary factor of production. Much of our natural capital, such as biodiversity and ecosystem services, is based on land and there is little debate over the importance of land use for economic activity and to feed growing populations\n",

      "2|The demographic shift in the last few decades – from just over 3 billion in 1960 to more than 7 billion – has caused a dramatic rise in the demand for food production, with land used for crops and ranching increasing at the expense of natural grasslands and forests. Farmlands account for almost 38% of the global land surface\n",

      "2|It is expected that more than 1 billion hectares of additional land, mostly in developing countries, would be converted for agricultural use by 2050 to keep up with current trends. However, the continued pressures on land, and the ecosystem services such as water retention, carbon storage, soil health and all living organisms that it supports, are bound to bring about biodiversity loss and climate change.\n",

      "4|For example, notwithstanding varied practices across the world, land use, land-use change, and forestry cause 23% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally.

We need a transformative change in the way we use land, if we are to continue to reap the benefits of nature and avoid a catastrophic collapse of our planet’s ecosystems.

      "2|Nevertheless, an increasing number of international oil and gas companies have set out seemingly ambitious goals to transition to “net-zero” carbon emissions by 2050. What is behind these new announcements? Are they just greenwashing, or do they represent a genuine intent to transform firms in the face of the accelerating energy transition?

Nearly 20 years ago, BP rebranded to “beyond petroleum”, pledging to control emissions and become leaders in promoting environmental sustainability. Investments did follow, but by 2013 most of BP’s renewable energy assets had been sold off. So, will this time be different?\n",
      "\n",
      "4|There does appear to be more momentum than ever before. At least two of the recent commitments – those of BP and ENI – crucially include Scope 3 emissions. Scope 3 emissions encompass indirect emissions across a company’s value chain, including from the use of their products. For an oil and gas company, this implies a radical change of business model, well beyond reducing emissions from the companies’ own operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|BP in particular made two startling announcements as the pandemic started to take hold. First, the firm cut its long-term oil price forecast for oil by 30%, leading to a write-down of assets by between USD 13 and USD 17.5 billion. Perhaps more surprising than the write-down itself was the reason given: that the pandemic will “accelerate the pace of transition to a lower-carbon economy and energy system”. Second, BP has begun planning with expectations of a carbon price of USD 100 per tonne by 2030 – a big step up from the current USD 40.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|And yet key questions remain about the nature of the pledges and how they will be achieved. What does the “net” actually entail – what level of residual emissions, and what kind of offsets or carbon removal? How will firms go about reinventing themselves? Does this mean shifting towards renewable electricity (an entirely different business model), producing low-carbon fuels, eliminating methane emissions (currently around 15% of all energy-related GHG emissions), developing carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), or all of the above and more? Crucially, when will the necessary investment be forthcoming? As recently as 2019, 99% of firms’ capital investment was flowing into core oil and gas projects – a far cry from reinvention. Even among those firms that have net-zero plans for mid-century, most of them do not include intermediate targets. Clarity on some of these questions may come from the forthcoming Science-based Targets methodology for the oil and gas sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Further, the footprint of oil and gas majors that have announced ambitious climate plans remains small relative to overall production. In particular, nationally owned oil companies have been much slower to join the party. But these state-owned firms account for over half of global production (and even greater share of reserves) and control a larger proportion of low-cost oil, making them more likely to continue producing in a low oil price world. That said, October 2020 saw a promising sign of change with Malaysia’s Petronas becoming the first NOC to pledge net zero by 2050.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|While the devil is in the detail of these pledges, it is clear that they imply a transition to energy firms with little resemblance to those of today, requiring new skills, new business models, and new technologies. What is driving firms to think about such reinvention now, even at a time of severe financial difficulty?\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Investor activism is part of the picture, as environmentally conscious stakeholders such as Climate Action 100+ and socially active pension funds like the Church of England have raised pressure for reform. Reputation management, staff retention and anticipation of future regulation are also at play. But changes are also being driven by the market and the need to ensure access to finance in a world where oil is worth less as demand peaks, carbon prices rise, climate risk disclosure becomes the norm, and high-emission and high-cost projects face real risks of becoming stranded assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Market signals are already picking up on this new reality. In early October, NextEra, the biggest wind energy producer in the US and one of the biggest solar energy producers, overtook ExxonMobil as the most valuable US energy company by market capitalisation. More broadly, renewables have been more resilient than fossil fuels in the face of the Covid-19 crisis and renewable energy firms in Germany, France, the UK and US have outperformed oil & gas stocks since the onset of the COVID 19 crisis, as well as over the previous ten years.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|To put these pledges in context, the challenge of heading off dangerous climate change is still immense. Because of COVID-19, global emissions are expected to drop steeply in 2020. But to stand a good chance of keeping the increase in global temperature to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, emissions will need to continue to decline at nearly the same rate – around 8% – every year from now until 2030. The global economy simply cannot pick up as it was before.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|In that light, the OECD and others have highlighted the potential for stimulus packages to accelerate the transition to net-zero emissions as part of a “green recovery”. Stimulus measures so far announced do include meaningful support for the green transition – in particular in the EU – but much more needs to be done. The OECD reports that while at least 30 countries among the OECD its key partners have included measures to support the transition to greener economies as part of their recovery programmes, many are also planning measures that will likely have direct or indirectly negative impacts on the environment. According to Energy Policy Tracker estimates, G20 countries have so far committed USD 234.73 billion in support to fossil fuel energy versus USD 151.29 billion for clean energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In that light, the slew of pledges from the oil and gas sector helps to highlight an opportunity as governments continue to refine recovery packages. What better signal that a green recovery is good for growth and jobs than for some of the world’s most profitable companies to voluntarily pledge their own transformation? Governments can take heed by continuing to reorient energy stimulus towards clean energy, while actively supporting the needed transition in skills and workforce.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Renewable-energy technologies are critically important, both in addressing the risks of climate change and achieving Sustainable Development Goal number 7 (SDG7,) relative to affordable and clean energy. They have also become increasingly cost-competitive: the capital cost of utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) energy has fallen by more than 60 per cent since 2010, and that of onshore wind energy by 20 per cent.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|There is no shortage of capital available globally to finance renewable-energy projects. The financial sector encompasses more than €100 trillion of assets. So how is it that investment in renewable energy is not flowing faster?\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The trillion-dollar question is how we can shift incentives and strengthen the right conditions to make solar, wind and other renewable power more attractive to investors. To respect the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting temperature rise to well below 2°C, annual investment in renewable energy needs to increase by 150 per cent between now and 2050.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In order to meet renewable energy deployment goals, policy makers need to strengthen investment conditions, from investment policy to competition, trade and financial market policy. And most importantly, specific policy incentives and climate policies should not be considered in isolation from the broader environment for investment and innovation in renewable energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|At the policy level, scaling up investment in deployed renewables requires designing targeted incentives such as: feed-in tariffs (i.e. a guaranteed minimum price per unit of renewable power generated); renewable energy certificates (a certificate proving that one unit of electricity was generated from a renewables source, which can be sold separately from the underlying physical electricity associated with a renewable-based generation source); and public tenders (which include public competitive bidding or auctions for a set capacity of renewable power).\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Feed-in tariffs and certificates in particular have driven investment in advanced countries, leading, for example, to an 11 per cent increase in renewables investment for each additional unit of feed-in tariff, in USD/KWh. Auctions and tenders have supported renewables investment in emerging markets (OECD analysis shows that, historically, increasing the capacity of a tender by 1 MW leads to a 0.1 per cent increase in renewables investment flows).\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Explicit carbon prices (using carbon taxes or emissions trading schemes) have driven investment in renewables in the European Union and in emerging economies, and across OECD and G20 countries in solar energy. But at the same time, pressure from fossil-fuel subsidies in the electricity sector has also deterred renewables investment in emerging economies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Incompatible incentives are worrying on a number of fronts, not only for investment in deployed renewables but also innovation in earlier-stage renewables technologies. An example: feed-in tariffs stimulate renewable-energy patents, yet policy across OECD countries and emerging economies has been shifting away from FiTs toward public tenders, to adjust to changing market conditions, control the deployment of large-scale renewables, and reduce costs for consumers.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Also, government spending in research, development and demonstration (RD&D) for low-carbon technologies is at historic lows. This has negative implications for innovation; OECD research shows that public RD&D expenditures have thus far played an important role in stimulating patenting in renewables technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|In addition to aligning our incentives, we need to take advantage of the fact that some climate mitigation policies enhance the positive effects of other policies when they are combined. For example, setting carbon prices while providing public RD&D spending in renewables technologies has worked well for mobilising renewables investment in emerging markets. In OECD countries, Denmark has become a leader in renewables technologies, including by providing integrated, sector-wide policy support to RD&D and deployment of renewables.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Finally, we need to work at making sure that the broader investment environment isn’t at odds with low-carbon investment. For example, the implementation of Basel III banking regulations – though they are important – also may have had the unintended consequence of constraining access to debt financing for capital-intensive renewable projects\n",

      "2|Investment in renewable energy and other low-carbon technologies needs to take place on a far greater scale if we are to achieve the ambition of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals.

The analysis provides a projection of the four major markets (China, the European Union, Japan and the United States) between 2015 and 2035 under a two degree scenario identified by the International Energy Agency. The results of the analysis suggest that by 2035 green bonds have the potential to scale to USD 4.7-5.6 trillion in outstanding securities and USD 620-720 billion in annual issuance for these key three sectors in the four markets.\n",

In these deep pools of capital, there is plenty of room for the green bond market to grow.\n",

A starting point would be to explore multi-level governance solutions that allow cities to continue developing in a sustainable manner.

Discussions at the Forum will address how different countries and cities, including rapidly urbanising emerging countries, can design and adopt specific urban green growth models that work for them. The latest OECD publication Green Growth in Bandung under the project Urban Green Growth in Dynamic Asia identifies opportunities for urban green growth in areas such as land use and transport, among others.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The GGSD Forum takes place at an opportune time. Growing recognition by city mayors in recent years has prompted the creation of numerous multi-stakeholder coalitions that address sustainability in urban environments, such as the Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy and C40 Cities. Recent discussions at the Habitat III Summit in Quito examined how countries can implement the New Urban Agenda, a far-reaching global agreement to achieve the urbanisation and sustainability targets of the Sustainable Development Goals endorsed by world leaders last year.\n",

      "3|The researchers have described their new \"optical rectennas\" in a paper published today in the journal Nature Communications. These devices, which are too small to see with the naked eye, are roughly 100 times more efficient than similar tools used for energy harvesting. And they achieve that feat through a mysterious process called \"resonant tunneling\" -- in which electrons pass through solid matter without spending any energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Rectennas (short for \"rectifying antennas\"), she explained, work a bit like car radio antennas. But instead of picking up radio waves and turning them into tunes, optical rectennas absorb light and heat and convert it into power.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|They're also potential game changers in the world of renewable energy. Working rectennas could, theoretically, harvest the heat coming from factory smokestacks or bakery ovens that would otherwise go to waste. Some scientists have even proposed mounting these devices on airships that would fly high above the planet's surface to capture the energy radiating from Earth to outer space.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|But, so far, rectennas haven't been able to reach the efficiencies needed to meet those goals. Until now, perhaps. In the new study, Belkadi and her colleagues have designed the first-ever rectennas that are capable of generating power.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|\"We demonstrate for the first time electrons undergoing resonant tunneling in an energy-harvesting optical rectenna,\" she said. \"Until now, it was only a theoretical possibility.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2|\"This innovation makes a significant step toward making rectennas more practical,\" he said. \"Right now, the efficiency is really low, but it's going to increase.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4|It's a development that Moddel, who has literally written the book on these devices, has been looking forward to for a long time. Rectennas have been around since 1964 when an engineer named William C. Brown used microwaves to power a small helicopter. They're relatively simple tools, made up of an antenna, which absorbs radiation, and a diode, which converts that energy into DC currents.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The problem, however, is that to capture thermal radiation and not just microwaves, rectennas need to be incredibly small -- many times thinner than a human hair. And that can cause a range of problems. The smaller an electrical device is, for example, the higher its resistance becomes, which can shrink the power output of a rectenna.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|\"You need this device to have very low resistance, but it also needs to be really responsive to light,\" Belkadi said. \"Anything you do to make the device better in one way would make the other worse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2|For decades, in other words, optical rectennas seemed like a no-win scenario. That is until Belkadi and her colleagues, who include postdoctoral researcher Ayendra Weerakkody, landed on a solution: Why not sidestep that obstacle entirely?\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Belkadi explained that in a traditional rectenna, electrons must pass through an insulator in order to generate power. These insulators add a lot of resistance to the devices, reducing the amount of electricity that engineers can get out.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|In the latest study, however, the researchers decided to add two insulators to their devices, not just one. That addition had the counterintuitive effect of creating an energetic phenomenon called a quantum \"well.\" If electrons hit this well with just the right energy, they can use it to tunnel through the two insulators -- experiencing no resistance in the process. It's not unlike a ghost drifting through a wall unperturbed. A graduate student in Moddel's research group had previously theorized that such spectral behavior could be possible in optical rectennas, but, until now, no one had been able to prove it.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|\"If you choose your materials right and get them at the right thickness, then it creates this sort of energy level where electrons see no resistance,\" Belkadi said. \"They just go zooming through.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3|And that means more power. To test the spooky effect, Belkadi and her colleagues arrayed a network of about 250,000 rectennas, which are shaped like tiny bowties, onto a hot plate in the lab. Then they cranked up the heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|\"If we use different materials or change our insulators, then we may be able to make that well deeper,\" she said. \"The deeper the well is, the more electrons can pass all the way through.\"\n",

      "2|With the rise of the digital age, the amount of WiFi sources to transmit information wirelessly between devices has grown exponentially. This results in the widespread use of the 2.4GHz radio frequency that WiFi uses, with excess signals available to be tapped for alternative uses.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|To harness this under-utilised source of energy, a research team from the National University of Singapore (NUS) and Japan's Tohoku University (TU) has developed a technology that uses tiny smart devices known as spin-torque oscillators (STOs) to harvest and convert wireless radio frequencies into energy to power small electronics. In their study, the researchers had successfully harvested energy using WiFi-band signals to power a light-emitting diode (LED) wirelessly, and without using any battery.\n",

      "4|\"We are surrounded by WiFi signals, but when we are not using them to access the Internet, they are inactive, and this is a huge waste. Our latest result is a step towards turning readily-available 2.4GHz radio waves into a green source of energy, hence reducing the need for batteries to power electronics that we use regularly. In this way, small electric gadgets and sensors can be powered wirelessly by using radio frequency waves as part of the Internet of Things. With the advent of smart homes and cities, our work could give rise to energy-efficient applications in communication, computing, and neuromorphic systems,\" said Professor Yang Hyunsoo from the NUS Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, who spearheaded the project.\n",

      "2|Spin-torque oscillators are a class of emerging devices that generate microwaves, and have applications in wireless communication systems. However, the application of STOs is hindered due to a low output power and broad linewidth.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|While mutual synchronisation of multiple STOs is a way to overcome this problem, current schemes, such as short-range magnetic coupling between multiple STOs, have spatial restrictions. On the other hand, long-range electrical synchronisation using vortex oscillators is limited in frequency responses of only a few hundred MHz. It also requires dedicated current sources for the individual STOs, which can complicate the overall on-chip implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|To overcome the spatial and low frequency limitations, the research team came up with an array in which eight STOs are connected in series. Using this array, the 2.4 GHz electromagnetic radio waves that WiFi uses was converted into a direct voltage signal, which was then transmitted to a capacitor to light up a 1.6-volt LED. When the capacitor was charged for five seconds, it was able to light up the same LED for one minute after the wireless power was switched off.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|In their study, the researchers also highlighted the importance of electrical topology for designing on-chip STO systems, and compared the series design with the parallel one. They found that the parallel configuration is more useful for wireless transmission due to better time-domain stability, spectral noise behaviour, and control over impedance mismatch. On the other hand, series connections have an advantage for energy harvesting due to the additive effect of the diode-voltage from STOs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Commenting on the significance of their results, Dr Raghav Sharma, the first author of the paper, shared, \"Aside from coming up with an STO array for wireless transmission and energy harvesting, our work also demonstrated control over the synchronising state of coupled STOs using injection locking from an external radio-frequency source. These results are important for prospective applications of synchronised STOs, such as fast-speed neuromorphic computing.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "3|Spintronics is an emerging technology for manufacturing electronic devices that take advantage of electron spin and its associated magnetic properties, instead of using the electrical charge of an electron, to carry information. Antiferromagnetic materials are attracting attention in spintronics, with the expectation of spin operations with higher stability. Unlike ferromagnetic materials, in which atoms align along the same direction like in the typical refrigerator magnets, magnetic atoms inside antiferromagnets have antiparallel spin alignments that cancel out the net magnetization.\n",

      "3|Scientists have worked on controlling the alignment of magnetic atoms within antiferromagnetic materials to create magnetic switches. Conventionally, this has been done using a 'field-cooling' procedure, which heats and then cools a magnetic system containing an antiferromagnet, while applying an external magnetic field. However, this process is inefficient for use in many micro- or nano- structured spintronics devices because the spatial resolution of the process itself is not high enough to be applied in a micro- or nano-scale devices.\n",

      "2|The platinum generates heat by combusting any methanol vapor that comes in contact with it. By varying the exposure to fuel in a periodic pattern, the temperature varies and the micromuscle accordions\n",
      "\n",
      "2|That motion causes the bot’s forelegs to rear up. When the legs scooch back again, the body drags forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|This beetle bot may weigh only as much as three grains of rice but to crawl it needs a tiny yet mighty source of fuel. Instead of tethering it to a power source, scientists stowed methanol inside the robot’s body, where it powers an artificial micromuscle. That self-contained fuel could be a crucial advance in creating bots that can swarm into tight spaces during search-and-rescue missions.\n",

      "3|Towards the end of the summer of 1969 – a few weeks after the moon landings, a few days after Woodstock, and a month before the first broadcast of Monty Python's Flying Circus – a large grey metal box was delivered to the office of Leonard Kleinrock, a professor at the University of California in Los Angeles. It was the same size and shape as a household refrigerator, and outwardly, at least, it had about as much charm. But Kleinrock was thrilled: a photograph from the time shows him standing beside it, in requisite late-60s brown tie and brown trousers, beaming like a proud father.\n",

      "4|Had he tried to explain his excitement to anyone but his closest colleagues, they probably wouldn't have understood. The few outsiders who knew of the box's existence couldn't even get its name right: it was an IMP, or \"interface message processor\", but the year before, when a Boston company had won the contract to build it, its local senator, Ted Kennedy, sent a telegram praising its ecumenical spirit in creating the first \"interfaith message processor\". Needless to say, though, the box that arrived outside Kleinrock's office wasn't a machine capable of fostering understanding among the great religions of the world. It was much more important than that.\n",

      "4|It's impossible to say for certain when the internet began, mainly because nobody can agree on what, precisely, the internet is. (This is only partly a philosophical question: it is also a matter of egos, since several of the people who made key contributions are anxious to claim the credit.) But 29 October 1969 – 40 years ago next week – has a strong claim for being, as Kleinrock puts it today, \"the day the infant internet uttered its first words\". At 10.30pm, as Kleinrock's fellow professors and students crowded around, a computer was connected to the IMP, which made contact with a second IMP, attached to a second computer, several hundred miles away at the Stanford Research Institute, and an undergraduate named Charley Kline tapped out a message. Samuel Morse, sending the first telegraph message 125 years previously, chose the portentous phrase: \"What hath God wrought?\" But Kline's task was to log in remotely from LA to the Stanford machine, and there was no opportunity for portentousness: his instructions were to type the command LOGIN.\n",

Here's one of countless statistics that are liable to induce feelings akin to vertigo: on New Year's Day 1994 – only yesterday, in other words – there were an estimated 623 websites\n",

      "1|\"This isn't a matter of ego or crowing,\" says Steve Crocker, who was present that day at UCLA in 1969, \"but there has not been, in the entire history of mankind, anything that has changed so dramatically as computer communications, in terms of the rate of change.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Looking back now, Kleinrock and Crocker are both struck by how, as young computer scientists, they were simultaneously aware that they were involved in something momentous and, at the same time, merely addressing a fairly mundane technical problem. On the one hand, they were there because of the Russian Sputnik satellite launch, in 1957, which panicked the American defence establishment, prompting Eisenhower to channel millions of dollars into scientific research, and establishing Arpa, the Advanced Research Projects Agency, to try to win the arms technology race\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The idea was \"that we would not get surprised again,\" said Robert Taylor, the Arpa scientist who secured the money for the Arpanet, persuading the agency's head to give him a million dollars that had been earmarked for ballistic missile research. With another pioneer of the early internet, JCR Licklider, Taylor co-wrote the paper, \"The Computer As A Communication Device\", which hinted at what was to come\n",
      "\n",
      "2|\"In a few years, men will be able to communicate more effectively through a machine than face to face,\" they declared. \"That is rather a startling thing to say, but it is our conclusion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2|On the other hand, the breakthrough accomplished that night in 1969 was a decidedly down-to-earth one. The Arpanet was not, in itself, intended as some kind of secret weapon to put the Soviets in their place: it was simply a way to enable researchers to access computers remotely, because computers were still vast and expensive, and the scientists needed a way to share resources\n",
      "\n",
      "2|(The notion that the network was designed so that it would survive a nuclear attack is an urban myth, though some of those involved sometimes used that argument to obtain funding.) The technical problem solved by the IMPs wasn't very exciting, either. It was already possible to link computers by telephone lines, but it was glacially slow, and every computer in the network had to be connected, by a dedicated line, to every other computer, which meant you couldn't connect more than a handful of machines without everything becoming monstrously complex and costly\n",
      "\n",
      "1|The solution, called \"packet switching\" – which owed its existence to the work of a British physicist, Donald Davies – involved breaking data down into blocks that could be routed around any part of the network that happened to be free, before getting reassembled at the other end.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|\"I thought this was important, but I didn't really think it was as challenging as what I thought of as the 'real research',\" says Crocker, a genial Californian, now 65, who went on to play a key role in the expansion of the internet. \"I was particularly fascinated, in those days, by artificial intelligence, and by trying to understand how people think. I thought that was a much more substantial and respectable research topic than merely connecting up a few machines. That was certainly useful, but it wasn't art.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Still, Kleinrock recalls a tangible sense of excitement that night as Kline sat down at the SDS Sigma 7 computer, connected to the IMP, and at the same time made telephone contact with his opposite number at Stanford. As his colleagues watched, he typed the letter L, to begin the word LOGIN.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Kline typed a G, at which point the system crashed, and the connection was lost. The G didn't make it through, which meant that, quite by accident, the first message ever transmitted across the nascent internet turned out, after all, to be fittingly biblical:\n",
      "\n",
      "2|One of the most intriguing things about the growth of the internet is this: to a select group of technological thinkers, the surprise wasn't how quickly it spread across the world, remaking business, culture and politics – but that it took so long to get off the ground. Even when computers were mainly run on punch-cards and paper tape, there were whispers that it was inevitable that they would one day work collectively, in a network, rather than individually\n",
      "\n",
      "2|(Tracing the origins of online culture even further back is some people's idea of an entertaining game: there are those who will tell you that the Talmud, the book of Jewish law, contains a form of hypertext, the linking-and-clicking structure at the heart of the web.) In 1945, the American presidential science adviser, Vannevar Bush, was already imagining the \"memex\", a device in which \"an individual stores all his books, records, and communications\", which would be linked to each other by \"a mesh of associative trails\", like weblinks. Others had frenzied visions of the world's machines turning into a kind of conscious brain\n",
      "\n",
      "2|And in 1946, an astonishingly complete vision of the future appeared in the magazine Astounding Science Fiction. In a story entitled A Logic Named Joe, the author Murray Leinster envisioned a world in which every home was equipped with a tabletop box that he called a \"logic\":\n",
      "\n",
      "2|\"You got a logic in your house. It looks like a vision receiver used to, only it's got keys instead of dials and you punch the keys for what you wanna get \n",

      "\n",
      "2|you punch 'Sally Hancock's Phone' an' the screen blinks an' sputters an' you're hooked up with the logic in her house an' if somebody answers you got a vision-phone connection. But besides that, if you punch for the weather forecast [or] who was mistress of the White House durin' Garfield's administration \n",

      "\n",
      "3|Despite all these predictions, though, the arrival of the internet in the shape we know it today was never a matter of inevitability. It was a crucial idiosyncracy of the Arpanet that its funding came from the American defence establishment – but that the millions ended up on university campuses, with researchers who embraced an anti-establishment ethic, and who in many cases were committedly leftwing; one computer scientist took great pleasure in wearing an anti-Vietnam badge to a briefing at the Pentagon. Instead of smothering their research in the utmost secrecy – as you might expect of a cold war project aimed at winning a technological battle against Moscow – they made public every step of their thinking, in documents known as Requests For Comments.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Deliberately or not, they helped encourage a vibrant culture of hobbyists on the fringes of academia – students and rank amateurs who built their own electronic bulletin-board systems and eventually FidoNet, a network to connect them to each other. An argument can be made that these unofficial tinkerings did as much to create the public internet as did the Arpanet. Well into the 90s, by the time the Arpanet had been replaced by NSFNet, a larger government-funded network, it was still the official position that only academic researchers, and those affiliated to them, were supposed to use the network. It was the hobbyists, making unofficial connections into the main system, who first opened the internet up to allcomers.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|What made all of this possible, on a technical level, was simultaneously the dullest-sounding and most crucial development since Kleinrock's first message. This was the software known as TCP/IP, which made it possible for networks to connect to other networks, creating a \"network of networks\", capable of expanding virtually infinitely – which is another way of defining what the internet is\n",
      "\n",
      "2|It's for this reason that the inventors of TCP/IP, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, are contenders for the title of fathers of the internet, although Kleinrock, understandably, disagrees. \"Let me use an analogy,\" he says\n",

      "2|The spread of the internet across the Atlantic, through academia and eventually to the public, is a tale too intricate to recount here, though it bears mentioning that British Telecom and the British government didn't really want the internet at all: along with other European governments, they were in favour of a different networking technology, Open Systems Interconnect. Nevertheless, by July 1992, an Essex-born businessman named Cliff Stanford had opened Demon Internet, Britain's first commercial internet service provider\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Officially, the public still wasn't meant to be connecting to the internet. \"But it was never a real problem,\" Stanford says today\n",
      "\n",
      "1|\"The people trying to enforce that weren't working very hard to make it happen, and the people working to do the opposite were working much harder.\" The French consulate in London was an early customer, paying Demon £10 a month instead of thousands of pounds to lease a private line to Paris from BT.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|After a year or so, Demon had between 2,000 and 3,000 users, but they weren't always clear why they had signed up: it was as if they had sensed the direction of the future, in some inchoate fashion, but hadn't thought things through any further than that. \"The question we always got was: 'OK, I'm connected – what do I do now?'\" Stanford recalls. \"It was one of the most common questions on our support line. We would answer with 'Well, what do you want to do? Do you want to send an email?' 'Well, I don't know anyone with an email address.' People got connected, but they didn't know what was meant to happen next.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Fortunately, a couple of years previously, a British scientist based at Cern, the physics laboratory outside Geneva, had begun to answer that question, and by 1993 his answer was beginning to be known to the general public. What happened next was the web.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|I sent my first email in 1994, not long after arriving at university, from a small, under-ventilated computer room that smelt strongly of sweat. Email had been in existence for decades by then – the @ symbol was introduced in 1971, and the first message, according to the programmer who sent it, Ray Tomlinson, was \"something like QWERTYUIOP\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2|(The test messages, Tomlinson has said, \"were entirely forgettable, and I have, therefore, forgotten them\".) But according to an unscientific poll of friends, family and colleagues, 1994 seems fairly typical: I was neither an early adopter nor a late one. A couple of years later I got my first mobile phone, which came with two batteries: a very large one, for normal use, and an extremely large one, for those occasions on which you might actually want a few hours of power\n",
      "\n",
      "2|By the time I arrived at the Guardian, email was in use, but only as an add-on to the internal messaging system, operated via chunky beige terminals with green-on-black screens. It took for ever to find the @ symbol on the keyboard, and I don't remember anything like an inbox, a sent-mail folder, or attachments\n",

      "1|I am 34 years old, but sometimes I feel like Methuselah.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|I have no recollection of when I first used the world wide web, though it was almost certainly when people still called it the world wide web, or even W3, perhaps in the same breath as the phrase \"information superhighway\", made popular by Al Gore. (Or \"infobahn\": did any of us really, ever, call the internet the \"infobahn\"?) For most of us, though, the web is in effect synonymous with the internet, even if we grasp that in technical terms that's inaccurate: the web is simply a system that sits on top of the internet, making it greatly easier to navigate the information there, and to use it as a medium of sharing and communication. But the distinction rarely seems relevant in everyday life now, which is why its inventor, Tim Berners-Lee, has his own legitimate claim to be the progenitor of the internet as we know it. The first ever website was his own, at CERN: info.cern.ch.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The idea that a network of computers might enable a specific new way of thinking about information, instead of just allowing people to access the data on each other's terminals, had been around for as long as the idea of the network itself: it's there in Vannevar Bush's memex, and Murray Leinster's logics. But the grandest expression of it was Project Xanadu, launched in 1960 by the American philosopher Ted Nelson, who imagined – and started to build – a vast repository for every piece of writing in existence, with everything connected to everything else according to a principle he called \"transclusion\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2|It was also, presciently, intended as a method for handling many of the problems that would come to plague the media in the age of the internet, automatically channelling small royalties back to the authors of anything that was linked. Xanadu was a mind-spinning vision – and at least according to an unflattering portrayal by Wired magazine in 1995, over which Nelson threatened to sue, led those attempting to create it into a rabbit-hole of confusion, backbiting and \"heart-slashing despair\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Nelson continues to develop Xanadu today, arguing that it is a vastly superior alternative to the web. \"WE FIGHT ON,\" the Xanadu website declares, sounding rather beleaguered, not least since the declaration is made on a website.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Web browsers crossed the border into mainstream use far more rapidly than had been the case with the internet itself: Mosaic launched in 1993 and Netscape followed soon after, though it was an embarrassingly long time before Microsoft realised the commercial necessity of getting involved at all. Amazon and eBay were online by 1995\n",
      "\n",
      "2|And in 1998 came Google, offering a powerful new way to search the proliferating mass of information on the web. Until not too long before Google, it had been common for search or directory websites to boast about how much of the web's information they had indexed – the relic of a brief period, hilarious in hindsight, when a user might genuinely have hoped to check all the webpages that mentioned a given subject\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Google, and others, saw that the key to the web's future would be helping users exclude almost everything on any given topic, restricting search results to the most relevant pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Without most of us quite noticing when it happened, the web went from being a strange new curiosity to a background condition of everyday life: I have no memory of there being an intermediate stage, when, say, half the information I needed on a particular topic could be found online, while the other half still required visits to libraries. \"I remember the first time I saw a web address on the side of a truck, and I thought, huh, OK, something's happening here,\" says Spike Ilacqua, who years beforehand had helped found The World, the first commercial internet service provider in the US. Finally, he stopped telling acquaintances that he worked in \"computers\", and started to say that he worked on \"the internet\", and nobody thought that was strange.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|It is absurd – though also unavoidable here – to compact the whole of what happened from then onwards into a few sentences: the dotcom boom, the historically unprecedented dotcom bust, the growing \"digital divide\", and then the hugely significant flourishing, over the last seven years, of what became known as Web 2.0. It is only this latter period that has revealed the true capacity of the web for \"generativity\", for the publishing of blogs by anyone who could type, for podcasting and video-sharing, for the undermining of totalitarian regimes, for the use of sites such as Twitter and Facebook to create (and ruin) friendships, spread fashions and rumours, or organise political resistance. But you almost certainly know all this: it's part of what these days, in many parts of the world, we call \"just being alive\".\n",
      "\n",
      "4|The most confounding thing of all is that in a few years' time, all this stupendous change will probably seem like not very much change at all. As Crocker points out, when you're dealing with exponential growth, the distance from A to B looks huge until you get to point C, whereupon the distance between A and B looks like almost nothing; when you get to point D, the distance between B and C looks similarly tiny. One day, presumably, everything that has happened in the last 40 years will look like early throat-clearings — mere preparations for whatever the internet is destined to become. We will be the equivalents of the late-60s computer engineers, in their horn-rimmed glasses, brown suits, and brown ties, strange, period-costume characters populating some dimly remembered past.\n",

      "\n",
      "2|Jobs was the fox, after all, and PARC was the henhouse. What would he be allowed to see? What wouldn’t he be allowed to see? Some at PARC thought that the whole idea was lunacy, but, in the end, Xerox went ahead with it\n",
      "\n",
      "2|One PARC scientist recalls Jobs as “rambunctious”—a fresh-cheeked, caffeinated version of today’s austere digital emperor. He was given a couple of tours, and he ended up standing in front of a Xerox Alto, PARC’s prized personal computer.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|An engineer named Larry Tesler conducted the demonstration. He moved the cursor across the screen with the aid of a “mouse.” Directing a conventional computer, in those days, meant typing in a command on the keyboard\n",

      "\n",
      "2|“Jobs was pacing around the room, acting up the whole time,” Tesler recalled. “He was very excited\n",

      "2|After Jobs returned from PARC, he met with a man named Dean Hovey, who was one of the founders of the industrial-design firm that would become known as IDEO. “Jobs went to Xerox PARC on a Wednesday or a Thursday, and I saw him on the Friday afternoon,” Hovey recalled\n",

      "2|“I had a series of ideas that I wanted to bounce off him, and I barely got two words out of my mouth when he said, ‘No, no, no, you’ve got to do a mouse.’ I was, like, ‘What’s a mouse?’ I didn’t have a clue. So he explains it, and he says, ‘You know, [the Xerox mouse] is a mouse that cost three hundred dollars to build and it breaks within two weeks\n",

      "2|Here’s your design spec: Our mouse needs to be manufacturable for less than fifteen bucks.

      "\n",
      "2|I bought a butter dish. That was the beginnings of the mouse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2|I spoke with Hovey in a ramshackle building in downtown Palo Alto, where his firm had started out. He had asked the current tenant if he could borrow his old office for the morning, just for the fun of telling the story of the Apple mouse in the place where it was invented\n",

      "\n",
      "2|“We didn’t tell the planning commission. We went and got that clear corrugated stuff and put it across the top for a roof\n",

      "2|He had brought a big plastic bag full of the artifacts of that moment: diagrams scribbled on lined paper, dozens of differently sized plastic mouse shells, a spool of guitar wire, a tiny set of wheels from a toy train set, and the metal lid from a jar of Ralph’s preserves. He turned the lid over\n",
      "\n",
      "2|It was filled with a waxlike substance, the middle of which had a round indentation, in the shape of a small ball. “It’s epoxy casting resin,” he said\n",
      "\n",
      "2|“You pour it, and then I put Vaseline on a smooth steel ball, and set it in the resin, and it hardens around it.” He tucked the steel ball underneath the lid and rolled it around the tabletop. “It’s a kind of mouse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The hard part was that the roller ball needed to be connected to the housing of the mouse, so that it didn’t fall out, and so that it could transmit information about its movements to the cursor on the screen. But if the friction created by those connections was greater than the friction between the tabletop and the roller ball, the mouse would skip\n",
      "\n",
      "2|And the more the mouse was used the more dust it would pick up off the tabletop, and the more it would skip. The Xerox PARC mouse was an elaborate affair, with an array of ball bearings supporting the roller ball\n",
      "\n",
      "1|But there was too much friction on the top of the ball, and it couldn’t deal with dust and grime.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|At first, Hovey set to work with various arrangements of ball bearings, but nothing quite worked. “This was the ‘aha’ moment,” Hovey said, placing his fingers loosely around the sides of the ball, so that they barely touched its surface\n",
      "\n",
      "2|“So the ball’s sitting here. And it rolls\n",
      "\n",
      "2|I attribute that not to the table but to the oldness of the building. The floor’s not level\n",
      "\n",
      "2|So I started playing with it, and that’s when I realized: I want it to roll. I don’t want it to be supported by all kinds of ball bearings\n",
      "\n",
      "1|I want to just barely touch it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The trick was to connect the ball to the rest of the mouse at the two points where there was the least friction—right where his fingertips had been, dead center on either side of the ball. “If it’s right at midpoint, there’s no force causing it to rotate. So it rolls.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Hovey estimated their consulting fee at thirty-five dollars an hour; the whole project cost perhaps a hundred thousand dollars. “I originally pitched Apple on doing this mostly for royalties, as opposed to a consulting job,” he recalled\n",
      "\n",
      "2|“I said, ‘I’m thinking fifty cents apiece,’ because I was thinking that they’d sell fifty thousand, maybe a hundred thousand of them.” He burst out laughing, because of how far off his estimates ended up being. “Steve’s pretty savvy\n",

      "2|He said no. Maybe if I’d asked for a nickel, I would have been fine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Here is the first complicating fact about the Jobs visit. In the legend of Xerox PARC, Jobs stole the personal computer from Xerox\n",
      "\n",
      "2|But the striking thing about Jobs’s instructions to Hovey is that he didn’t want to reproduce what he saw at PARC. “You know, there were disputes around the number of buttons—three buttons, two buttons, one-button mouse,” Hovey went on\n",

      "2|“The mouse at Xerox had three buttons. But we came around to the fact that learning to mouse is a feat in and of itself, and to make it as simple as possible, with just one button, was pretty important.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2|So was what Jobs took from Xerox the idea of the mouse? Not quite, because Xerox never owned the idea of the mouse. The PARC researchers got it from the computer scientist Douglas Engelbart, at Stanford Research Institute, fifteen minutes away on the other side of the university campus\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Engelbart dreamed up the idea of moving the cursor around the screen with a stand-alone mechanical “animal” back in the mid- nineteen-sixties. His mouse was a bulky, rectangular affair, with what looked like steel roller-skate wheels\n",
      "\n",
      "2|If you lined up Engelbart’s mouse, Xerox’s mouse, and Apple’s mouse, you would not see the serial reproduction of an object. You would see the evolution of a concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The same is true of the graphical user interface that so captured Jobs’s imagination. Xerox PARC’s innovation had been to replace the traditional computer command line with onscreen icons\n",
      "\n",
      "2|But when you clicked on an icon you got a pop-up menu: this was the intermediary between the user’s intention and the computer’s response. Jobs’s software team took the graphical interface a giant step further\n",
      "\n",
      "2|It emphasized “direct manipulation.” If you wanted to make a window bigger, you just pulled on its corner and made it bigger; if you wanted to move a window across the screen, you just grabbed it and moved it. The Apple designers also invented the menu bar, the pull-down menu, and the trash can—all features that radically simplified the original Xerox PARC idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|The difference between direct and indirect manipulation—between three buttons and one button, three hundred dollars and fifteen dollars, and a roller ball supported by ball bearings and a free-rolling ball—is not trivial. It is the difference between something intended for experts, which is what Xerox PARC had in mind, and something that’s appropriate for a mass audience, which is what Apple had in mind. PARC was building a personal computer. Apple wanted to build a popular computer.\n",

You can tell Schneider spent all night preparing for this interview, jotting down the words he wanted to emphasize, \"efficacy,\" \"toxicity,\" \"Nuremberg laws,\" \"forced sterilization.\" He even ends with \"people have to stand up and get educated.

(In the years between the founding of Napster and Helm’s death, total consumer spending on recorded music in the United States dropped by roughly seventy per cent.)

Franklin, the eldest of the three famous Foer brothers, is a journalist, and he began his career, in the mid-nineties, working for Slate, which had then just been founded by Microsoft. The experience, Foer writes, was “exhilarating.” Later, he became the editor of The New Republic. The magazine was on the brink of ruin when, in 2012, it was purchased by Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook, whose personal fortune was estimated at half a billion dollars.\n",

And the number of people who choose not to vaccinate their children (so-called philosophical exemptions are available in about 20 states, including Pennsylvania, Texas, and much of the West) continues to rise. In states where such opting out is allowed, 2.6 percent of parents did so last year, up from 1 percent in 1991, according to the CDC. In some communities, like California's affluent Marin County, just north of San Francisco, non-vaccination rates are approaching 6 percent (counterintuitively, higher rates of non-vaccination often correspond with higher levels of education and wealth).\n",

      "3|That may not sound like much, but a recent study by the Los Angeles Times indicates that the impact can be devastating. The Times found that even though only about 2 percent of California's kindergartners are unvaccinated (10,000 kids, or about twice the number as in 1997), they tend to be clustered, disproportionately increasing the risk of an outbreak of such largely eradicated diseases as measles, mumps, and pertussis (whooping cough). The clustering means almost 10 percent of elementary schools statewide may already be at risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|In May, The New England Journal of Medicine laid the blame for clusters of disease outbreaks throughout the US squarely at the feet of declining vaccination rates, while nonprofit health care provider Kaiser Permanente reported that unvaccinated children were 23 times more likely to get pertussis, a highly contagious bacterial disease that causes violent coughing and is potentially lethal to infants. In the June issue of the journal Pediatrics, Jason Glanz, an epidemiologist at Kaiser's Institute for Health Research, revealed that the number of reported pertussis cases jumped from 1,000 in 1976 to 26,000 in 2004. A disease that vaccines made rare, in other words, is making a comeback. \"This study helps dispel one of the commonly held beliefs among vaccine-refusing parents: that their children are not at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases,\" Glanz says.\n",

      "4|It seems that Americans are in the midst of a raging epidemic of mental illness, at least as judged by the increase in the numbers treated for it. The tally of those who are so disabled by mental disorders that they qualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) increased nearly two and a half times between 1987 and 2007—from one in 184 Americans to one in seventy-six. For children, the rise is even more startling—a thirty-five-fold increase in the same two decades.

The categories were “anxiety disorders,” including, among other subcategories, phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); “mood disorders,” including major depression and bipolar disorders; “impulse-control disorders,” including various behavioral problems and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); and “substance use disorders,” including alcohol and drug abuse.

      "2|The shift from “talk therapy” to drugs as the dominant mode of treatment coincides with the emergence over the past four decades of the theory that mental illness is caused primarily by chemical imbalances in the brain that can be corrected by specific drugs.

      "2|Second, none of the three authors subscribes to the popular theory that mental illness is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. As Whitaker tells the story, that theory had its genesis shortly after psychoactive drugs were introduced in the 1950s\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The first was Thorazine (chlorpromazine), which was launched in 1954 as a “major tranquilizer” and quickly found widespread use in mental hospitals to calm psychotic patients, mainly those with schizophrenia. Thorazine was followed the next year by Miltown (meprobamate), sold as a “minor tranquilizer” to treat anxiety in outpatients\n",
      "\n",
      "1|And in 1957, Marsilid (iproniazid) came on the market as a “psychic energizer” to treat depression.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In the space of three short years, then, drugs had become available to treat what at that time were regarded as the three major categories of mental illness—psychosis, anxiety, and depression—and the face of psychiatry was totally transformed. These drugs, however, had not initially been developed to treat mental illness\n",
      "\n",
      "2|They had been derived from drugs meant to treat infections, and were found only serendipitously to alter the mental state. At first, no one had any idea how they worked\n",
      "\n",
      "2|They simply blunted disturbing mental symptoms. But over the next decade, researchers found that these drugs, and the newer psychoactive drugs that quickly followed, affected the levels of certain chemicals in the brain.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Some brief—and necessarily quite simplified—background: the brain contains billions of nerve cells, called neurons, arrayed in immensely complicated networks and communicating with one another constantly. The typical neuron has multiple filamentous extensions, one called an axon and the others called dendrites, through which it sends and receives signals from other neurons\n",
      "\n",
      "2|For one neuron to communicate with another, however, the signal must be transmitted across the tiny space separating them, called a synapse. To accomplish that, the axon of the sending neuron releases a chemical, called a neurotransmitter, into the synapse\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The neurotransmitter crosses the synapse and attaches to receptors on the second neuron, often a dendrite, thereby activating or inhibiting the receiving cell. Axons have multiple terminals, so each neuron has multiple synapses\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Afterward, the neurotransmitter is either reabsorbed by the first neuron or metabolized by enzymes so that the status quo ante is restored. There are exceptions and variations to this story, but that is the usual way neurons communicate with one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|When it was found that psychoactive drugs affect neurotransmitter levels in the brain, as evidenced mainly by the levels of their breakdown products in the spinal fluid, the theory arose that the cause of mental illness is an abnormality in the brain’s concentration of these chemicals that is specifically countered by the appropriate drug. For example, because Thorazine was found to lower dopamine levels in the brain, it was postulated that psychoses like schizophrenia are caused by too much dopamine. Or later, because certain antidepressants increase levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain, it was postulated that depression is caused by too little serotonin. (These antidepressants, like Prozac or Celexa, are called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) because they prevent the reabsorption of serotonin by the neurons that release it, so that more remains in the synapses to activate other neurons.) Thus, instead of developing a drug to treat an abnormality, an abnormality was postulated to fit a drug.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|That was a great leap in logic, as all three authors point out. It was entirely possible that drugs that affected neurotransmitter levels could relieve symptoms even if neurotransmitters had nothing to do with the illness in the first place (and even possible that they relieved symptoms through some other mode of action entirely). As Carlat puts it, “By this same logic one could argue that the cause of all pain conditions is a deficiency of opiates, since narcotic pain medications activate opiate receptors in the brain.” Or similarly, one could argue that fevers are caused by too little aspirin.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|But the main problem with the theory is that after decades of trying to prove it, researchers have still come up empty-handed. All three authors document the failure of scientists to find good evidence in its favor. Neurotransmitter function seems to be normal in people with mental illness before treatment. In Whitaker’s words:\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Do the drugs work? After all, regardless of the theory, that is the practical question. In his spare, remarkably engrossing book, The Emperor’s New Drugs, Kirsch describes his fifteen-year scientific quest to answer that question about antidepressants\n",
      "\n",
      "2|When he began his work in 1995, his main interest was in the effects of placebos. To study them, he and a colleague reviewed thirty-eight published clinical trials that compared various treatments for depression with placebos, or compared psychotherapy with no treatment\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Most such trials last for six to eight weeks, and during that time, patients tend to improve somewhat even without any treatment. But Kirsch found that placebos were three times as effective as no treatment\n",
      "\n",
      "2|That didn’t particularly surprise him. What did surprise him was the fact that antidepressants were only marginally better than placebos\n",
      "\n",
      "2|As judged by scales used to measure depression, placebos were 75 percent as effective as antidepressants. Kirsch then decided to repeat his study by examining a more complete and standardized data set.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The data he used were obtained from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) instead of the published literature. When drug companies seek approval from the FDA to market a new drug, they must submit to the agency all clinical trials they have sponsored\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The trials are usually double-blind and placebo-controlled, that is, the participating patients are randomly assigned to either drug or placebo, and neither they nor their doctors know which they have been assigned. The patients are told only that they will receive an active drug or a placebo, and they are also told of any side effects they might experience\n",
      "\n",
      "2|If two trials show that the drug is more effective than a placebo, the drug is generally approved. But companies may sponsor as many trials as they like, most of which could be negative—that is, fail to show effectiveness\n",
      "\n",
      "2|All they need is two positive ones. (The results of trials of the same drug can differ for many reasons, including the way the trial is designed and conducted, its size, and the types of patients studied.)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|For obvious reasons, drug companies make very sure that their positive studies are published in medical journals and doctors know about them, while the negative ones often languish unseen within the FDA, which regards them as proprietary and therefore confidential. This practice greatly biases the medical literature, medical education, and treatment decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Kirsch and his colleagues used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain FDA reviews of all placebo-controlled clinical trials, whether positive or negative, submitted for the initial approval of the six most widely used antidepressant drugs approved between 1987 and 1999—Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa, Serzone, and Effexor. This was a better data set than the one used in his previous study, not only because it included negative studies but because the FDA sets uniform quality standards for the trials it reviews and not all of the published research in Kirsch’s earlier study had been submitted to the FDA as part of a drug approval application.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Altogether, there were forty-two trials of the six drugs. Most of them were negative\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Overall, placebos were 82 percent as effective as the drugs, as measured by the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), a widely used score of symptoms of depression. The average difference between drug and placebo was only 1.8 points on the HAM-D, a difference that, while statistically significant, was clinically meaningless\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The results were much the same for all six drugs: they were all equally unimpressive. Yet because the positive studies were extensively publicized, while the negative ones were hidden, the public and the medical profession came to believe that these drugs were highly effective antidepressants.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Kirsch was also struck by another unexpected finding. In his earlier study and in work by others, he observed that even treatments that were not considered to be antidepressants—such as synthetic thyroid hormone, opiates, sedatives, stimulants, and some herbal remedies—were as effective as antidepressants in alleviating the symptoms of depression. Kirsch writes, “When administered as antidepressants, drugs that increase, decrease or have no effect on serotonin all relieve depression to about the same degree.” What all these “effective” drugs had in common was that they produced side effects, which participating patients had been told they might experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|It is important that clinical trials, particularly those dealing with subjective conditions like depression, remain double-blind, with neither patients nor doctors knowing whether or not they are getting a placebo. That prevents both patients and doctors from imagining improvements that are not there, something that is more likely if they believe the agent being administered is an active drug instead of a placebo. Faced with his findings that nearly any pill with side effects was slightly more effective in treating depression than an inert placebo, Kirsch speculated that the presence of side effects in individuals receiving drugs enabled them to guess correctly that they were getting active treatment—and this was borne out by interviews with patients and doctors—which made them more likely to report improvement. He suggests that the reason antidepressants appear to work better in relieving severe depression than in less severe cases is that patients with severe symptoms are likely to be on higher doses and therefore experience more side effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|To further investigate whether side effects bias responses, Kirsch looked at some trials that employed “active” placebos instead of inert ones. An active placebo is one that itself produces side effects, such as atropine—a drug that selectively blocks the action of certain types of nerve fibers\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Although not an antidepressant, atropine causes, among other things, a noticeably dry mouth. In trials using atropine as the placebo, there was no difference between the antidepressant and the active placebo\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Everyone had side effects of one type or another, and everyone reported the same level of improvement. Kirsch reported a number of other odd findings in clinical trials of antidepressants, including the fact that there is no dose-response curve—that is, high doses worked no better than low ones—which is extremely unlikely for truly effective drugs\n",
      "\n",
      "1|“Putting all this together,” writes Kirsch,\n",
      "\n",
      "4|leads to the conclusion that the relatively small difference between drugs and placebos might not be a real drug effect at all. Instead, it might be an enhanced placebo effect, produced by the fact that some patients have broken [the] blind and have come to realize whether they were given drug or placebo. If this is the case, then there is no real antidepressant drug effect at all. Rather than comparing placebo to drug, we have been comparing “regular” placebos to “extra-strength” placebos.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|That is a startling conclusion that flies in the face of widely accepted medical opinion, but Kirsch reaches it in a careful, logical way. Psychiatrists who use antidepressants—and that’s most of them—and patients who take them might insist that they know from clinical experience that the drugs work\n",
      "\n",
      "2|But anecdotes are known to be a treacherous way to evaluate medical treatments, since they are so subject to bias; they can suggest hypotheses to be studied, but they cannot prove them. That is why the development of the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in the middle of the past century was such an important advance in medical science\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Anecdotes about leeches or laetrile or megadoses of vitamin C, or any number of other popular treatments, could not stand up to the scrutiny of well-designed trials. Kirsch is a faithful proponent of the scientific method, and his voice therefore brings a welcome objectivity to a subject often swayed by anecdotes, emotions, or, as we will see, self-interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Whitaker’s book is broader and more polemical. He considers all mental illness, not just depression. Whereas Kirsch concludes that antidepressants are probably no more effective than placebos, Whitaker concludes that they and most of the other psychoactive drugs are not only ineffective but harmful. He begins by observing that even as drug treatment for mental illness has skyrocketed, so has the prevalence of the conditions treated:\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The number of disabled mentally ill has risen dramatically since 1955, and during the past two decades, a period when the prescribing of psychiatric medications has exploded, the number of adults and children disabled by mental illness has risen at a mind-boggling rate. Thus we arrive at an obvious question, even though it is heretical in kind: Could our drug-based paradigm of care, in some unforeseen way, be fueling this modern-day plague?\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Moreover, Whitaker contends, the natural history of mental illness has changed. Whereas conditions such as schizophrenia and depression were once mainly self-limited or episodic, with each episode usually lasting no more than six months and interspersed with long periods of normalcy, the conditions are now chronic and lifelong. Whitaker believes that this might be because drugs, even those that relieve symptoms in the short term, cause long-term mental harms that continue after the underlying illness would have naturally resolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|The evidence he marshals for this theory varies in quality. He doesn’t sufficiently acknowledge the difficulty of studying the natural history of any illness over a fifty-some-year time span during which many circumstances have changed, in addition to drug use. It is even more difficult to compare long-term outcomes in treated versus untreated patients, since treatment may be more likely in those with more severe disease at the outset. Nevertheless, Whitaker’s evidence is suggestive, if not conclusive.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|If psychoactive drugs do cause harm, as Whitaker contends, what is the mechanism? The answer, he believes, lies in their effects on neurotransmitters. It is well understood that psychoactive drugs disturb neurotransmitter function, even if that was not the cause of the illness in the first place\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Whitaker describes a chain of effects. When, for example, an SSRI antidepressant like Celexa increases serotonin levels in synapses, it stimulates compensatory changes through a process called negative feedback\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In response to the high levels of serotonin, the neurons that secrete it (presynaptic neurons) release less of it, and the postsynaptic neurons become desensitized to it. In effect, the brain is trying to nullify the drug’s effects\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The same is true for drugs that block neurotransmitters, except in reverse. For example, most antipsychotic drugs block dopamine, but the presynaptic neurons compensate by releasing more of it, and the postsynaptic neurons take it up more avidly\n",
      "\n",
      "1|(This explanation is necessarily oversimplified, since many psychoactive drugs affect more than one of the many neurotransmitters.)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|With long-term use of psychoactive drugs, the result is, in the words of Steve Hyman, a former director of the NIMH and until recently provost of Harvard University, “substantial and long-lasting alterations in neural function.” As quoted by Whitaker, the brain, Hyman wrote, begins to function in a manner “qualitatively as well as quantitatively different from the normal state.” After several weeks on psychoactive drugs, the brain’s compensatory efforts begin to fail, and side effects emerge that reflect the mechanism of action of the drugs. For example, the SSRIs may cause episodes of mania, because of the excess of serotonin\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Antipsychotics cause side effects that resemble Parkinson’s disease, because of the depletion of dopamine (which is also depleted in Parkinson’s disease). As side effects emerge, they are often treated by other drugs, and many patients end up on a cocktail of psychoactive drugs prescribed for a cocktail of diagnoses\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The episodes of mania caused by antidepressants may lead to a new diagnosis of “bipolar disorder” and treatment with a “mood stabilizer,” such as Depokote (an anticonvulsant) plus one of the newer antipsychotic drugs. And so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Some patients take as many as six psychoactive drugs daily. One well- respected researcher, Nancy Andreasen, and her colleagues published evidence that the use of antipsychotic drugs is associated with shrinkage of the brain, and that the effect is directly related to the dose and duration of treatment\n",
      "\n",
      "2|As Andreasen explained to The New York Times, “The prefrontal cortex doesn’t get the input it needs and is being shut down by drugs. That reduces the psychotic symptoms\n",
      "\n",
      "1|It also causes the prefrontal cortex to slowly atrophy.”*\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Getting off the drugs is exceedingly difficult, according to Whitaker, because when they are withdrawn the compensatory mechanisms are left unopposed. When Celexa is withdrawn, serotonin levels fall precipitously because the presynaptic neurons are not releasing normal amounts and the postsynaptic neurons no longer have enough receptors for it. Similarly, when an antipsychotic is withdrawn, dopamine levels may skyrocket. The symptoms produced by withdrawing psychoactive drugs are often confused with relapses of the original disorder, which can lead psychiatrists to resume drug treatment, perhaps at higher doses.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Unlike the cool Kirsch, Whitaker is outraged by what he sees as an iatrogenic (i.e., inadvertent and medically introduced) epidemic of brain dysfunction, particularly that caused by the widespread use of the newer (“atypical”) antipsychotics, such as Zyprexa, which cause serious side effects. Here is what he calls his “quick thought experiment”:\n",

      "2|Imagine that a virus suddenly appears in our society that makes people sleep twelve, fourteen hours a day. Those infected with it move about somewhat slowly and seem emotionally disengaged\n",

      "2|Many gain huge amounts of weight—twenty, forty, sixty, and even one hundred pounds. Often their blood sugar levels soar, and so do their cholesterol levels\n",
      "\n",
      "2|A number of those struck by the mysterious illness—including young children and teenagers—become diabetic in fairly short order…. The federal government gives hundreds of millions of dollars to scientists at the best universities to decipher the inner workings of this virus, and they report that the reason it causes such global dysfunction is that it blocks a multitude of neurotransmitter receptors in the brain—dopaminergic, serotonergic, muscarinic, adrenergic, and histaminergic\n",
      "\n",
      "2|All of those neuronal pathways in the brain are compromised. Meanwhile, MRI studies find that over a period of several years, the virus shrinks the cerebral cortex, and this shrinkage is tied to cognitive decline\n",

      "3|The first time that Salvador Camacho thought he was going to die he was sitting in his father’s Chrysler sedan with a friend listening to music. The 22-year-old engineering student was parked near his home in the central Mexican city of Toluca and in the fading evening light he didn’t notice two tattooed men approach. Tori Amos’s hit, “Bliss”, had just started playing when the gang members pointed guns at the young men.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|So began a 24-hour ordeal. Strong willed and solidly built, Camacho was singled out as the more stubborn of the pair\n",
      "\n",
      "2|He was blindfolded and beaten. One robber eventually threw him to the ground, put a gun to the back of his head and told him it was time to die\n",
      "\n",
      "1|He passed out, waking in a field with his hands tied behind his back, almost naked.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Camacho survived but, traumatised, he sank into depression. Soon he was drinking heavily and binge eating. His weight ballooned from a trim 70kg to 103kg.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|That led to his second near-death experience, eight years later, in 2007. He remembers waking up and blinking at bright lights: he was being wheeled on a stretcher into a hospital emergency ward, with an attack of severe arrhythmia, or irregular heart beat. “A cardiologist told me that if I didn’t lose weight and get my health under control I would be dead in five years,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|That second crisis forced Camacho belatedly to deal with the trauma of the first. To help with what he now understands was post-traumatic stress disorder, he started having counselling and taking anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs. To address his physical health, he tried to lose weight. This effort propelled him to the centre of one of the most fraught scientific debates of our age: the calorie wars, a fierce disagreement about diet and weight control.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Today, more than a decade after his cardiologist’s stark warning, Camacho lives in the Swiss city of Basel. He is relaxed and confident, except when two topics come up\n",
      "\n",
      "2|When he recounts his kidnapping his gaze drops, his smile vanishes and he becomes noticeably quieter, although he says his panic attacks have virtually disappeared. The other touchy topic is weight control, which causes him to shake his head in anger at what he and millions of other dieters have gone through\n",
      "\n",
      "2|“It’s just ridiculous,” he says with exasperation and a touch of venom. “People are living with real pain and guilt and all they get is advice that is confused or just plain wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The guidance that Camacho’s doctors gave him, along with a string of nutritionists and his own online research, was unanimous. It would be familiar to the millions of people who have ever tried to diet. “Everybody tells you that to lose weight you have to eat less and move more,” he says, “and the way to do that is to count your calories.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3|At his heaviest, Camacho’s body-mass index – the ratio of his height to his weight – reached 35.6, well above the 30 mark that doctors define as clinically obese. Most government guidelines indicated that, as a man, he needed 2,500 calories a day to maintain his weight (the target for women is 2,000). Nutritionists told Camacho that if he ate fewer than 2,000 calories a day, a weekly “deficit” of 3,500 would mean that he would lose 0.5kg a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|With a desk job as a planning engineer in a Mexican hospital, he knew it would take real discipline to trim his pudgy frame. But as his kidnappers had quickly realised, he is an unusually determined character. He began getting up before dawn each day to run 10km. He also started accounting for every morsel of food he consumed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|“I filled in Excel spreadsheets every night, every week and every month listing everything I ate. It became a real obsession for me,” says Camacho\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Out went the Burger King Whoppers, fried tacos packed with pork and cheese, and tortas (Mexican sandwiches filled with meat, refried beans, avocado and peppers). Out too went his usual steady flow of beer and wine\n",
      "\n",
      "1|In came carefully measured low-fat cheese and turkey sandwiches, salads, canned peach juice, Gatorade and Coke Zero, with three Special-K low-calorie diet bars a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|“I was always tired and hungry and I would get really moody and distracted,” he says. “I was thinking about food all the time.” He was constantly told that if he got the maths right – consuming fewer calories than he burned each day – the results would soon show\n",
      "\n",
      "2|“I really did everything you are supposed to do,” he insists with the tone of a schoolboy who completed his homework yet still failed a big test. He bought a battery of exercise monitoring devices to measure how many calories he was expending on his runs\n",
      "\n",
      "2|“I was told to exercise for at least 45 minutes at least four or five times a week. I actually ran for more than an hour every day.” He kept to low-fat, low-calorie food for three years\n",
      "\n",
      "2|It simply didn’t work. At one point he lost about 10kg but his weight rebounded, though he still restricted his calories.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Dieters the world over will be familiar with Camacho’s frustrations. Most studies show that more than 80% of people regain any lost weight in the long term. And like him, when we fail, most of us assume that we are too lazy or greedy – that we are at fault.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|As a general rule it is true that if you eat vastly fewer calories than you burn, you’ll get slimmer (and if you consume far more, you’ll get fatter). But the myriad faddy diets flogged to us each year belie the simplicity of the formula that Camacho was given\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The calorie as a scientific measurement is not in dispute. But calculating the exact calorific content of food is far harder than the confidently precise numbers displayed on food packets suggest\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Two items of food with identical calorific values may be digested in very different ways. Each body processes calories differently\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Even for a single individual, the time of day that you eat matters. The more we probe, the more we realise that tallying calories will do little to help us control our weight or even maintain a healthy diet: the beguiling simplicity of counting calories in and calories out is dangerously flawed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The calorie is ubiquitous in daily life. It takes top billing on the information label of most packaged food and drinks\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Ever more restaurants list the number of calories in each dish on their menus. Counting the calories we expend has become just as standard\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Gym equipment, fitness devices around our wrists, even our phones tell us how many calories we have supposedly burned in a single exercise session or over the course of a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|It wasn’t always thus. For centuries, scientists assumed that it was the mass of food consumed that was significant. In the late 16th century an Italian physician named Santorio Sanctorius invented a “weighing chair”, dangling from a giant scale, in which he sat at regular intervals to weigh himself, everything he ate and drank, and all the faeces and urine he produced. Despite 30 years of compulsive chair dangling, Sanctorius answered few of his own questions about the impact that his consumption had on his body.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Only later did the focus shift to the energy different foodstuffs contained. In the 18th century Antoine Lavoisier, a French aristocrat, worked out that burning a candle required a gas from the air – which he named oxygen – to fuel the flame and release heat and other gases\n",
      "\n",
      "2|He applied the same principle to food, concluding that it fuels the body like a slow-burning fire. He built a calorimeter, a device big enough to hold a guinea pig, and measured the heat the creature generated to estimate how much energy it was producing\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Unfortunately the French revolution – specifically the guillotine – cut short his thinking on the subject. But he had started something\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Other scientists later constructed “bomb calori­meters” in which they burned food to measure the heat – and thus the potential energy – released from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|The calorie – which comes from “calor”, the Latin for “heat” – was originally used to measure the efficiency of steam engines: one calorie is the energy required to heat 1kg of water by one degree Celsius. Only in the 1860s did German scientists begin using it to calculate the energy in food. It was an American agricultural chemist, Wilbur Atwater, who popularised the idea that it could be used to measure both the energy contained in food and the energy the body expended on things like muscular work, tissue repair and powering the organs. In 1887, after a trip to Germany, he wrote a series of wildly popular articles in Century, an American magazine, suggesting that “food is to the body what fuel is to the fire.” He introduced the public to the notion of “macronutrients” – carbohydrates, protein and fat – so called because the body needs a lot of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Today many of us want to monitor our calorie consumption in order to lose or maintain our weight. Atwater, the son of a Methodist minister, was motivated by the opposite concern: at a time when malnutrition was widespread, he sought to help poor people find the most cost-effective items to fill themselves up.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|To see how much energy different macronutrients provided to the body, he fed samples of an “average” American diet of that era – which he believed to be heavy in molasses cookies, barley meal and chicken gizzards – to a group of male students in a basement at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. For up to 12 days at a time a volunteer would eat, sleep and lift weights while sealed inside a six-foot-high chamber measuring four feet wide by seven feet deep. The energy in each meal was calculated by burning identical foods in a bomb calorimeter.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The walls were filled with water, and changes in its temperature allowed Atwater to calculate how much energy the students’ bodies were generating. His team collected the students’ faeces and burned that too, to see how much energy had been left in the body in the digestion process.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This was pioneering stuff for the 1890s. Atwater eventually concluded that a gram of either carbohydrate or protein made an average of four calories of energy available to the body, and a gram of fat offered an average of 8.9 calories, a figure later rounded up to nine calories for convenience\n",
      "\n",
      "2|We now know far more about the workings of the human body: Atwater was right that some of a meal’s potential energy was excreted, but had no idea that some was also used to digest the meal itself, and that the body expends different amounts of energy depending on the food. Yet more than a century after igniting the faeces of Wesleyan students, the numbers Atwater calculated for each macro­nutrient remain the standard for measuring the calories in any given food stuff\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Those experiments were the basis of Salvador Camacho’s daily calorific arithmetic.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Atwater transformed the way the public thought about food, with his simple belief that “a calorie is a calorie”. He counselled the poor against eating too many leafy green vegetables because they weren’t sufficiently dense in energy. By his account, it made no difference whether calories came from chocolate or spinach: if the body absorbed more energy than it used, then it would store the excess as body fat, causing you to put on weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|That idea captured the public imagination. In 1918 the first book was published in America based on the notion that a healthy diet was no more complicated than the simple addition and subtraction of calories. “You may eat just what you like – candy, pie, cake, fat meat, butter, cream but count your calories!” wrote Lulu Hunt Peters in “Diet and Health”. “Now that you know you can have the things you like, proceed to make your menus containing very little of them.” The book sold millions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|By the 1930s the calorie had become entrenched in both the public mind and government policy. Its exclusive focus on the energy content of food, rather than its vitamin content, say, went virtually unchallenged\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Rising incomes and greater female participation in the workforce meant that by the 1960s people were eating out more often or buying prepared food, so they wanted more information about what they were consuming. Nutritional information on foodstuffs was widespread but haphazard; many items carried outlandish claims about their health benefits\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Labelling became standardised and mandatory in America only in 1990.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The emphasis and use of this information shifted too. By the late 1960s, obesity was becoming a pressing health concern as people became more sedentary and started eating highly processed foods and lots of sugar. As the number of people who needed to lose weight grew, changing diets became the focus of attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|So began the war on fat, in which Atwater’s calorie calculations were an unwitting ally. Because counting calories was seen as an objective arbiter of the health qualities of a foodstuff, it seemed logical that the most calorie-laden part of any food item – fat – must be bad for you\n",
      "\n",
      "2|By this measure, dishes low in calories, but rich in sugar and carbohydrates, seemed healthier. People were increasingly willing to blame fat for many of the health ills of modern life, helped along by the sugar lobby: in 2016, a researcher at the University of California uncovered documents from 1967 showing that sugar companies secretly funded studies at Harvard University designed to blame fat for the growing obesity epidemic\n",
      "\n",
      "1|That the dietary “fat” found in olive oil, bacon and butter is branded with the same word as the unwanted flesh around our middles made it all the easier to demonise.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|A US Senate committee report in 1977 recommended a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet for all, and other governments followed suit. The food industry responded with enthusiasm, removing fat, the most calorie-dense of macronutrients, from food items and replacing it with sugar, starch and salt. As a bonus, the thousands of new cheap and tasty “low-cal” and “low-fat” products which Camacho used to diet tended to have longer shelf lives and higher profit margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|But this didn’t lead to the expected improvements in public health. Instead, it coincided almost exactly with the most dramatic rise in obesity in human history\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Between 1975 and 2016 obesity almost tripled worldwide, according to the World Health Organisation ( WHO ): nearly 40% of over-18s – some 1.9bn adults – are now overweight. That contributed to a rapid rise in cardiovascular diseases (mainly heart disease and stroke) which became the leading cause of death worldwide\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Rates of type-2 diabetes, which is often linked to lifestyle and diet, have more than doubled since 1980.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|It wasn’t only wealthy countries that saw such trends. In Mexico, middle-class urban families such as Camacho’s got fatter too\n",
      "\n",
      "2|As a child Camacho was fit and loved playing football. But at the age of ten, in 1988, he was one of many young Mexicans who started stacking on weight as increasing trade with America saw cheap sweets and fizzy drinks flood the shops, a process known as the “Coca-colonisation” of Mexico\n",
      "\n",
      "2|“There were suddenly all these flavours you had never tasted, with chocolates, candies and Dr Pepper,” Camacho remembers: “Overnight I got fat.” When his uncles teased him about his bulging waistline, he cut back on sweets and stayed in good shape until his kidnapping 12 years later. Other Mexicans just kept bulking up\n",
      "\n",
      "1|In 2013 Mexico overtook America as the most obese country in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|To combat this trend, governments worldwide have enshrined calorie-counting in policy. The WHO attributes the “fundamental cause” of obesity worldwide to “an energy imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended”\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Governments the world over persist in offering the same advice: count and cut calories. This has infiltrated ever more areas of life\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In 2018 the American government ordered food chains and vending machines to provide calorie details on their menus, to help consumers make “informed and healthful decisions”. Australia and Britain are headed in similar directions\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Government bodies advise dieters to record their meals in a calorie journal to lose weight. The experimental efforts of a 19th-century scientist stand barely changed – and are barely questioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Millions of dieters give up when their calorie-counting is unsuccessful. Camacho was more stubborn than most\n",
      "\n",
      "2|He took photos of his meals to record his intake more accurately, and would log into his calorie spreadsheets from his phone. He thought about every morsel he ate\n",
      "\n",
      "2|And he bought a proliferation of gadgets to track his calorie output. But he still didn’t lose much weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|One problem was that his sums were based on the idea that calorie counts are accurate. Food producers give impressively specific readings: a slice of Camacho’s favourite Domino’s double pepperoni pizza is supposedly 248 calories (not 247 nor 249). Yet the number of calories listed on food packets and menus are routinely wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Susan Roberts, a nutritionist at Tufts University in Boston, has found that labels on American packaged foods miss their true calorie counts by an average of 8%. American government regulations allow such labels to understate calories by up to 20% (to ensure that consumers are not short-changed in terms of how much nutrition they receive). The information on some processed frozen foods misstates their calorific content by as much as 70%.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|That isn’t the only problem. Calorie counts are based on how much heat a foodstuff gives off when it burns in an oven\n",
      "\n",
      "2|But the human body is far more complex than an oven. When food is burned in a laboratory it surrenders its calories within seconds\n",
      "\n",
      "2|By contrast, the real-life journey from dinner plate to toilet bowl takes on average about a day, but can range from eight to 80 hours depending on the person. A calorie of carbohydrate and a calorie of protein both have the same amount of stored energy, so they perform identically in an oven\n",
      "\n",
      "2|But put those calories into real bodies and they behave quite differently. And we are still learning new insights: American researchers discovered last year that, for more than a century, we’ve been exaggerating by about 20% the number of calories we absorb from almonds.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The process of storing fat – the “weight” many people seek to lose – is influenced by dozens of other factors. Apart from calories, our genes, the trillions of bacteria that live in our gut, food preparation and sleep affect how we process food\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Academic discussions of food and nutrition are littered with references to huge bodies of research that still need to be conducted. “No other field of science or medicine sees such a lack of rigorous studies,” says Tim Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology at Kings College in London\n",
      "\n",
      "1|“We can create synthetic DNA and clone animals but we still know incredibly little about the stuff that keeps us alive.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2|What we do know, however, suggests that counting calories is very crude and often misleading. Think of a burger, the kind of food that Camacho eschewed during his early efforts to lose weight\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Take a bite and the saliva in your mouth starts to break it down, a process that continues when you swallow, transporting the morsel towards your stomach and beyond to be churned further. The digestive process transforms the protein, carbohydrates and fat in the burger into their basic compounds so that they are tiny enough to be absorbed into the bloodstream via the small intestine to fuel and repair the trillions of cells in the body\n",
      "\n",
      "1|But the basic molecules from each macronutrient play very different roles within the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|All carbohydrates break down into sugars, which are the body’s main fuel source. But the speed at which your body gets its fuel from food can be as important as the amount of fuel\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Simple carbohydrates are swiftly absorbed into the bloodstream, providing a fast shot of energy: the body absorbs the sugar from a can of fizzy drink at a rate of 30 calories a minute, compared with two calories a minute from complex carbohydrates such as potatoes or rice. That matters, because a sudden hit of sugar prompts the rapid release of insulin, a hormone that carries the sugar out of the bloodstream and into the body’s cells\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Problems arise when there is too much sugar in the blood. The liver can store some of the excess, but any that remains is stashed as fat\n",
      "\n",
      "2|So consuming large quantities of sugar is the fastest way to create body fat. And, once the insulin has done its work, blood-sugar levels slump, which tends to leave you hungry, as well as plumper.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Getting fat is a consequence of civilisation. Our ancestors would have enjoyed a heavy hit of sugar perhaps four times a year, when a new season produced fresh fruit. Many now enjoy that kind of sugar kick every day. The average person in the developed world consumes 20 times as much sugar as people did even during Atwater’s time.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|But it is a different story when you eat complex carbohydrates such as cereals. These are strung together from simple carbohydrates, so they also break down into sugar, but because they do so more slowly, your blood-sugar levels remain steadier. The fruit juices that Camacho was encouraged to drink contained fewer calories than one of his wholegrain buns but the bread delivered less of a sugar hit and left him feeling satiated for longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Other macronutrients have different functions. Protein, the dominant component of meat, fish and dairy products, acts as the main building block for bone, skin, hair and other body tissues. In the absence of sufficient quantities of carbohydrates it can also serve as fuel for the body. But since it is broken down more slowly than carbohydrates, protein is less likely to be converted to body fat.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Fat is a different matter again. It should leave you feeling fuller for longer, because your body splits it into tiny fatty acids more slowly than it processes carbohydrates or protein\n",
      "\n",
      "2|We all need fat to make hormones and to protect our nerves (a bit like plastic coating protects an electric wire). Over millennia, fat has also been a crucial way for humans to store energy, allowing us to survive periods of famine\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Nowadays, even without the risk of starvation, our bodies are programmed to store excess fuel in case we run out of food. No wonder a single measure – the energy content – can’t capture such complexity.\n",

      "2|Our fixation with counting calories assumes both that all calories are equal and that all bodies respond to calories in identical ways: Camacho was told that, since he was a man, he needed 2,500 calories a day to maintain his weight. Yet a growing body of research shows that when different people consume the same meal, the impact on each person’s blood sugar and fat formation will vary according to their genes, lifestyles and unique mix of gut bacteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Research published this year showed that a certain set of genes is found more often in overweight people than in skinny ones, suggesting that some people have to work harder than others to stay thin (a fact that many of us already felt intuitively to be true). Differences in gut microbiomes can alter how people process food. A study of 800 Israelis in 2015 found that the rise in their blood-sugar levels varied by a factor of four in response to identical food.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The response of your own body may also change depending on when you eat. Lose weight and your body will try to regain it, slowing down your metabolism and even reducing the energy you spend on fidgeting and twitching your muscles\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Even your eating and sleeping schedules can be important. Going without a full night’s sleep may spur your body to create more fatty tissue, which casts a grim light on Camacho’s years of early-morning exertion\n",
      "\n",
      "1|You may put on more weight eating small amounts over 12-15 hours than eating the same food in three distinct meals over a shorter period.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|There’s a further weakness in the calorie-counting system: the amount of energy we absorb from food depends on how we prepare it. Chopping and grinding food essentially does part of the work of digestion, making more calories available to your body by ripping apart cell walls before you eat it\n",
      "\n",
      "2|That effect is magnified when you add heat: cooking increases the proportion of food digested in the stomach and small intestine, from 50% to 95%. The digestible calories in beef rises by 15% on cooking, and in sweet potato some 40% (the exact change depends on whether it is boiled, roasted or microwaved)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|So significant is this impact that Richard Wrangham, a primatologist at Harvard University, reckons that cooking was necessary for human evolution. It enabled the neurological expansion that created Homo sapiens: powering the brain consumes about a fifth of a person’s metabolic energy each day (cooking also means we didn’t need to spend all day chewing, unlike chimps).\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The difficulty in counting accurately doesn’t stop there. The calorie load of carbohydrate-heavy items such as rice, pasta, bread and potatoes can be slashed simply by cooking, chilling and reheating them\n",
      "\n",
      "2|As starch molecules cool they form new structures that are harder to digest. You absorb fewer calories eating toast that has been left to go cold, or leftover spaghetti, than if they were freshly made\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Scientists in Sri Lanka discovered in 2015 that they could more than halve the calories potentially absorbed from rice by adding coconut oil during cooking and then cooling the rice. This made the starch less digestible so the body may take on fewer calories (they have yet to test on human beings the precise effects of rice cooked in this way)\n",

      "3|Different parts of a vegetable or fruit may be absorbed differently too: older leaves are tougher, for example. The starchy interior of sweetcorn kernels is easily digested but the cellulose husk is impossible to break down and passes through the body untouched. Just think about that moment when you look into the toilet bowl after eating sweetcorn.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|As with so many dieters, Camacho’s efforts to accurately track his calories “in” were doomed. But so too were his attempts to track his calories “out”\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The message from many public authorities and food producers, especially fast-food companies that sponsor sports events, is that even the unhealthiest foods will not make you fat if you do your part by taking plenty of exercise. Exercise does, of course, have clear health benefits\n",
      "\n",
      "2|But unless you’re a professional athlete, it plays a smaller part in weight control than most people believe. As much as 75% of the average person’s daily energy expenditure comes not through exercise but from ordinary daily activities and from keeping your body functioning by digesting food, powering organs and maintaining a regular body temperature\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Even drinking iced water – which delivers no energy – forces the body to burn calories to maintain its preferred temperature, making it the only known case of consuming something with “negative” calories. A popular expression in English tells us not to “compare apples and oranges” and assume them to be the same: yet calories put pizzas and oranges, or apples and ice cream, on the same scale, and deems them equal.\n",

      "2|After three years of dedicated calorie-counting Camacho changed tack. While recovering from running the 2010 marathon in San Diego he took up Crossfit training, an exercise regime that includes high-intensity training and weightlifting\n",

      "2|There he met people using a very different method to control their weight. Like him, they exercised regularly\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "2|Fed up with feeling like a hungry failure, he decided to give it a go. He ditched his heavily processed low-calorie products and focused on the quality of his food rather than quantity\n",
      "\n",
      "2|He stopped feeling ravenous all the time. “It sounds simple but I decided to listen to my body and eat whenever I was hungry but only when I was hungry, and to eat real food, not food ‘products’,” he says\n",
      "\n",
      "2|He went back to items that he’d long banned himself from eating. He had his first rasher of bacon in three years and enjoyed cheese, whole-fat milk and steaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|He immediately felt less hungry and happier. More surprising, he quickly began to lose his extra fat\n",
      "\n",
      "2|“I was sleeping so much better and within a couple of months I stopped the depression and anxiety medication,” he says. “I went from always feeling guilty and angry and afraid to feeling in control of myself and actually proud of my own body\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Suddenly I could enjoy eating and drinking again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The weight stayed off and in 2012 he moved to Heidelberg in Germany, a world away from the hectic streets of Mexico, to study for a masters degree in public health. “The idea hit me that I could combine my own experience with academic work to try to help other people overcome these various barriers that I had found.” After his masters he embarked on a doctorate on how to tackle obesity in Mexico.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Today he is married to a German scholar, Erica Gunther, who has studied food systems around the world. Their diet includes things he used to shun, such as egg yolks, olive oil and nuts. Two days a week the couple stick to vegetarian meals but otherwise he devours steak, kidneys, liver and some of his favourite Mexican dishes – barbacoa (lamb), carnitas (pork) and tacos with grilled meat.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|His wife enjoys making a traditional Mexican sweet pastry called pan de muerto (bread of death). “Before I would have run an extra two hours to compensate for eating that but now I don’t care, I just make sure it is a treat, not an everyday thing.” Having spent years trying to forgo alcohol, he has a glass or two of wine several times a week, and goes for a beer with friends from his gym.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Sweating through three or four workouts a week, he is as well-muscled as a professional rugby player. A stable 80kg, he has very little body fat, though he is still considered overweight by the body-mass-index charts, which rate many beefed-up professional athletes as too heavy. The only relapse of anxiety he suffers nowadays happens when he hears Tori Amos singing “Bliss” – the song playing when he was kidnapped – which he says “is a real pity because it’s a great song”.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Today Camacho could be described as a calorie dissident, one of a small but growing number of academics and scientists who say that the persistence of calorie-counting compounds the obesity epidemic, rather than remedying it. Counting calories has disrupted our ability to eat the right amount of food, he says, and has steered us towards poor choices\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In 2017 he wrote an academic paper that was one of the most savage attacks on the calorie system published in a peer-reviewed journal. “I’m actually embarrassed at what I used to believe,” he says\n",

      "1|“I was doing everything I could to follow the official advice but it was totally wrong and I feel stupid for never even questioning it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The simplicity of calorie-counting explains its appeal. Metrics that tell consumers the extent to which foods have been processed, or whether they will suppress hunger, are harder to understand. Faced with the calorie juggernaut, none has gained wide acceptance.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|The scientific and health establishment knows that the current system is flawed. A senior adviser to the UN ’s Food and Agriculture Organisation warned in 2002 that the Atwater “factors” of 4-4-9 at the heart of the calorie-counting system were “a gross oversimplification” and so inaccurate that they could mislead consumers into choosing unhealthy products because they understate the calories in some carbohydrates. The organisation said it would give “further consideration” to overhauling the system but 17 years later there is little momentum for change. It even rejected the idea of harmonising the many methods that are used in different countries – a label in Australia can give a different count from one in America for the same product.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Officials at the WHO also acknowledge the problems of the current system, but say it is so entrenched in consumer behaviour, public policy and industry standards that it would be too expensive and disruptive to make big changes. The experiments that Atwater conducted a century ago, without calculators or computers, have never been repeated even though our understanding of how our bodies work is vastly improved. There is little funding or enthusiasm for such work. As Susan Roberts at Tufts University says, collecting and analysing faeces “is the worst research job in the world”.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The calorie system, says Camacho, lets food producers off the hook: “They can say, ‘We’re not responsible for the unhealthy products we sell, we just have to list the calories and leave it to you to manage your own weight’.” Camacho and other calorie dissidents argue that sugar and highly processed carbohydrates play havoc with people’s hormonal systems. Higher insulin levels mean more energy is converted into fat tissues leaving less available to fuel the rest of the body\n",
      "\n",
      "2|That in turn drives hunger and overeating. In other words the constant hunger and fatigue suffered by Camacho and other dieters may be symptoms of being overweight, rather than the cause of the problem\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Yet much of the food industry defends the status quo too. To change how we assess the energy and health values of food would undermine the business model of many companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The only major organisation to shift the emphasis beyond calories is one dedicated to helping its customers slim down: Weight Watchers. In 2001 the world’s best-known dieting firm introduced a points system that moved away from focusing exclusively on calories to also classifying foods according to their sugar and saturated fat content, and their impact on appetite. Chris Stirk, the firm’s general manager in Britain, says the organisation made the change because relying on calories to lose weight is “outdated”: “Science evolves daily, monthly, yearly, let alone since the 1800s.”\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Many of us know instinctively that not all calories are the same. A lollipop and an apple may contain similar numbers of calories but the apple is clearly better for us. But after a lifetime of hearing about the calorie and its role in supposedly foolproof diet advice we could be forgiven for being confused about how best to eat. It’s time to lay it to rest.■\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The latest epidemic to terrify the Western world is Ebola, a virus that has killed hundreds in Africa in 2014 alone. No wonder there was so much worry when two infected health care workers from the United States were transported home from Liberia for treatment – why bring this plague to the US, exposing the rest of the country as well? But the truth is that Ebola, murderous though it is, doesn’t have what it takes to produce a pandemic, a worldwide outbreak of infectious disease. It spreads only through intimate contact with infected body fluids; to avoid Ebola, just refrain from touching sweat, blood or the bodies of the sick or dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Yet no logic can quell our pandemic paranoia, which first infected the zeitgeist with the publication of Laurie Garrett’s The Coming Plague (1994) and Richard Preston’s Hot Zone (1995). These books suggested that human incursion into rainforests and jungles would stir deadly viruses in wait; perturb nature and she nails you in the end. By the late 1990s, we were deep into the biological weapons scare, pumping billions of dollars in worldwide government funding to fight evil, lab-made disease. As if this weren’t enough, the panic caused from 2004 to 2007 by reports of the H5N1 or bird flu virus etched the prospect of a cross-species Andromeda strain in the Western mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The fear seems confirmed by historical memory: after all, plagues have killed a lot of people, and deadly diseases litter history like black confetti. The Antonine Plague, attributed to measles or smallpox in the year 165 CE, killed the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius and millions of his subjects\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The Justinian Plague, caused by the deadly bacterial pathogen Yersinia pestis, spread from North Africa across the Mediterranean Sea to Constantinople and other cities along the Mediterranean. By 542, infected rats and fleas had carried the infection as far north as Rennes in France and into the heart of Germany\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Millions died.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Then there was the Black Death of 1348-50, also caused by Yersinia pestis, but this time spread by human fleas and from human lung to human lung, through the air. The plague spread along the Silk Road to what is now Afghanistan, India, Persia, Constantinople, and thence across the Mediterranean to Italy and the rest of Europe, killing tens of millions worldwide. Of all the past pandemics, the 1918 influenza (also known as the Spanish flu) is now considered the über-threat, the rod by which all other pandemics are measured. It killed 40 million people around the globe.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|It was the great Australian virologist Frank Macfarlane Burnet who argued that the deadliest diseases were those newly introduced into the human species. It seemed to make sense: the parasite that kills its host is a dead parasite since, without the host, the germ has no way to survive and spread. According to this argument, new germs that erupt into our species will be potential triggers for pandemics, while germs that have a long history in a host species will have evolved to be relatively benign.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Many health experts take the notion further, contending that any coming plague will come from human intrusion into the natural world. One risk, they suggest, comes when hungry people in Africa and elsewhere forge deep into forests and jungles to hunt ‘bushmeat’ – rodents, rabbits, monkeys, apes – with exposure to dangerous pathogens the unhappy result. Those pathogens move silently among wild animals, but can also explode with terrifying ferocity among people when humans venture where they shouldn’t. According to the same line of thought, another proposed risk would result when birds spread a new pandemic strain to chickens in factory farms and, ultimately, to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|But there’s something in these scenarios that’s not entirely logical. There is nothing new in the intimate contact between animals and people\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Our hominid ancestors lived on wildlife before we ever evolved into Homo sapiens: that’s why anthropologists call them hunter-gatherers, a term that still applies to some modern peoples, including bushmeat hunters in West Africa. After domesticating animals, we lived close beside them, keeping cows, pigs and chickens in farmyards and even within households for thousands of years\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Pandemics arise out of more than mere contact between human beings and animals: from an evolutionary point of view, there is a missing step between animal pathogen and human pandemic that’s been almost completely overlooked in these terrifying but entirely speculative ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|According to the evolutionary epidemiologist Paul W Ewald of the University of Louisville, the most dangerous infectious diseases are almost always not animal diseases freshly broken into the human species, but diseases adapted to humanity over time: smallpox, malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, typhus, yellow fever, polio. In order to adapt to the human species, a germ needs to cycle among people – from person to person to person\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In each iteration, the strains best adapted to transmission will be the ones that spread. So natural selection will push circulating strains towards more and more effective transmission, and therefore towards increasing adaptation to human hosts\n",
      "\n",
      "1|This process necessarily takes place among people.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|That is why the idea that highly pathogenic animal viruses such as H5N1 bird flu cycling among chickens, for example, can suddenly mutate into a lethal, transmissible human virus makes little evolutionary sense. Adaptation to a new host is a precise and delicate business. To be a human-adapted germ means having the ability to infect human cells, to overcome human immunity, and to manipulate the human host into shedding the germ.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|A pathogen must force its new human host to act as a germ dispensary system: sneezing, coughing, spewing germ-laden particles in the air, or passing them through diarrhoea. To make us sneeze, a cold or flu virus somehow piggybacks on our evolved tendency to sneeze and cough to rid ourselves of irritants, whether that’s pollen or virus\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Sneezing out virus might help you reduce your viral load and recover more quickly, but it also ensures that your co-workers go home with a dose of what ails you. A virus that does not cause symptoms is much less likely to transmit\n",
      "\n",
      "2|On the other hand, if you are flattened immediately, the pathogen could be too virulent, immobilising you so thoroughly that you can’t get out to spread the disease. (Ebola is a standout example here.)\n",
      "\n",
      "2|But once they evolve the knack for human-to-human transmission, these same killer pathogens can cause devastating human disease. The usual suspects are well-known: smallpox, which survives in the external environment; cholera, which spreads in water; malaria, carried by insects; and Staphylococcus aureus, spread by unwitting hospital attendants and known today in deadliest, most antibiotic-resistant form as MRSA.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|One mysterious ancient outbreak, the Great Plague of Athens, shows how deadly epidemics unroll in time. The Plague – said to have been caused by typhus, measles, small pox or Ebola, depending on whom you ask – exploded in Athens in the summer of 430 BCE, during the early days of the Peloponnesian War, a 27-year struggle between Athens and Sparta over hegemony in the Hellenic world\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Pericles, the de facto leader of Athens, who pushed for war, developed a defensive strategy that proved fatal, to him and to as many as a third of Athenian citizens. He insisted on bringing all citizens – people who lived in the towns and rural areas outside the walled city – into Athens, leaving the rest of the city-state to be ravaged by the invading Spartans\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The Athenian Long Walls ran down to the separate ports of Piraeus and Phaleron, each of which lay about four miles from the City of Athens proper. Thus sealed off, fronting only on the sea, Athenians could shelter safely, Pericles argued, until the Peloponnesian War was won.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The normal population of the city was around 150,000. Scholars estimate that 200,000 to 250,000 farmers and townsmen and their families came streaming in, bringing everything they could carry with them – down to the woodwork on their farmhouse walls\n",
      "\n",
      "2|But Pericles had made no provision for the newcomers, who were used to their country manors, their quiet towns, their open fields. A few had homes or relatives within the walls\n",
      "\n",
      "2|But most had nowhere to go, and huddled in stifling huts, or in tents flung up in the narrow spaces between the walls. The crowded encampments were ripe for virulent infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|That infection came from the sea, the portal that Pericles had left open to feed the Athenian people and bring in enough money to keep the war effort alive. The Athenian historian Thucydides tells us that the disease originated in Ethiopia, travelled northward into Egypt and Libya, moved across the Mediterranean to the island of Lemnos, and on to Athens\n",
      "\n",
      "2|‘There was no record of the disease being so virulent anywhere else or causing so many deaths at it did in Athens,’ wrote Thucydides, and we have no reason to doubt him. This is a critical bit of information\n",
      "\n",
      "2|It tells us that the Great Plague evolved: it became much more lethal in the great refugee camp that wartime Athens had become. Thucydides continued:\n",
      "\n",
      "4|People in perfect health suddenly began to have burning feelings in the head; their eyes became red and inflamed; inside their mouths there was bleeding from the throat and tongue, and the breath became unnatural and unpleasant. The next symptoms were sneezing and hoarseness of voice, and before long the pain settled on the chest and was accompanied by coughing. Next the stomach was affected with stomach-aches and with vomitings of every kind of bile that has been given a name by the medical profession, and this being accompanied by great pain and difficulty. In most cases there were attacks of ineffectual retching, producing violent spasms; this sometimes ended with this stage of the disease, but sometimes continued long afterward.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Thucydides goes on to describe rashes, delirium, mental confusion and, among the survivors, blackened, dead tissue on the extremities, and sometimes blindness. This was a highly virulent, transmissible, systemic disease. Physicians and attendants died quickly, and the only people who could care for the sick were survivors immune to further infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The Athenian plague shows how a disease of mild to moderate virulence can heat up in what we can only call a ‘disease factory’ – a place where the sick are trapped together with the well, causing infection to spread like wildfire. If the Athenian infection was typhus, the most likely culprit, it would normally be spread by the human body louse and its infected faeces\n",
      "\n",
      "2|There must have been body lice among the Athenian squatters. Usually just scratching lice bites, thus digging louse faeces inadvertently into the skin, causes transmission\n",
      "\n",
      "2|But in crowded conditions, transmission of typhus can be more direct. For instance, in the Serbian prison camps of the First World War, where typhus was rampant, transmission through the air – possibly caused by aerosolised louse faeces – was known to occur\n",
      "\n",
      "1|The right conditions, in other words, can cause the short-term evolution of a louse-borne disease into something explosive.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|As Ewald has shown, a similar evolutionary process gave rise to the 1918 flu, propelled by the trench-warfare system of the Western Front. In the spring of 1918, a first wave of mild flu broke out in the US, and spread across the country to the troop ships loading for Europe\n",
      "\n",
      "2|From those ships, the infection spread into the trenches, where it swiftly heated up to deadly virulence in the disease factory conditions of the Front: the trenches, the trains, the trucks moving the wounded and the sick together, where virus from people immobilised by illness was able, over and over, to infect the well. The whole system was a giant viral delivery service\n",
      "\n",
      "1|The disease left the Western Front by several ports and exploded across the planet, killing about 2.5 per cent of those it infected – and it infected hundreds of millions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|This predatory influenza was not caused by some random combination of bird flu genes, as the new plague paranoia predicts. Both the Athenian Plague and the 1918 flu evolved in predictable Darwinian fashion. Germs that ravage the body more swiftly and effectively will outcompete milder strains. If those lethal strains have repeated access to fresh hosts, the brakes on virulence are off, and deadly disease evolves and spreads.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Looking at epidemics and pandemics through this evolutionary lens makes it clear that the most important condition necessary for the evolution of virulent, transmissible disease is the existence of a human disease factory. Without social conditions that allow the evolution of virulent, transmissible disease, deadly outbreaks are unlikely to emerge.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Deadliness itself isn’t that uncommon: SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which terrorised China in 2002 and 2003, killed 10 per cent of its victims; Ebola kills 60-90 per cent; untreated rabies kills close to 100 per cent, as does untreated pneumonic plague, caused by Yersinia pestis, the bacterial agent of the Black Death, the worst pandemic in human history. But to be both deadly and efficiently transmissible requires exacting circumstances. Even the Black Death – thought to come originally from Central Asian marmots – must have evolved in a chain of human-to-human transmission to become as lethally and effective as it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The Central African monkeypox virus (so called because it was first identified in macaques in 1958) has dangerous attributes: like the smallpox virus, it is often deadly, and it’s also a ‘sit-and-wait pathogen’, in Ewald’s terms – highly durable in the outside environment. Yet the evolution of monkeypox into a human disease such as smallpox seems, at this point, unlikely: some strains of monkeypox have transmitted from person to person for several iterations, but the chains of transmission have easily been broken, and the evolutionary process stopped in its tracks.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Instead, people continue to die of human-adapted disease. Malaria kills more than 1 million children annually\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Tuberculosis, in its ugliest, drug-resistant forms, is well-entrenched worldwide. Polio, despite our noblest efforts, continues to cripple and kill children\n",

      "1|Fighting existing pathogens seems more urgent than hunting for possible new ones – less exciting, but more likely to ease real suffering in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|If the Great Plague of Athens tells us anything, it is to avoid social conditions that allow pathogens to evolve great virulence and transmissibility. Preventing disease factories – trench-like warfare conditions, crowded hospitals, enormous refugee camps – is our best protection. While alarmists among us wait for the plague to pounce out of the jungle, it is far more likely to come from inside us, our disease factories and our social world.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Even more sobering: Many adults don’t get any activity at all, aside from what they need to make it through the day. And as we age, more and more of us stop moving. Almost 23 percent of adults between age 18 and 44 are sedentary. For those 65 and older, it’s around 32 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|While you likely know that long-term inactivity weakens your bones and muscles, you may not realize that it can damage your heart and brain, too. This, in turn, raises your odds of dementia and heart disease, among other conditions, and can lead to early death.\n",

      "2|“You really need to think about ways to keep moving,” says Kevin Bohnsack, MD, a family medicine physician at Saint Joseph Mercy Health System in Ann Arbor, Michigan. “Everything that increases your overall activity can ward off that sedentary lifestyle,” he adds—along with the cardiac and cognitive problems that can come with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|As you progress through middle age, your heart gradually begins to weaken. Its walls get thicker and less flexible, and your arteries become stiffer. This raises your risk for high blood pressure (hypertension) and other heart problems, including heart attack and heart failure. And if you’re sedentary, that risk goes up even more.\n",

      "3|When you exercise, your heart beats faster, increasing blood flow and supplying your body with necessary oxygen.

      "3|And though more studies are needed, research increasingly shows that exercise can boost your heart health no matter your age. For example, for one small study published in March 2018 in the journal Circulation, 28 middle-aged men completed two years of high-intensity exercise training. Compared to a control group, scientists found the exercise reduced their cardiac stiffness and increased their bodies’ capacity for oxygen use—both of which may slash the risk for heart failure.\n",

      "2|First, exercise is tied to improved cognition, which includes better memory, attention and executive function—things like controlling emotions and completing tasks. It can enhance the speed with which you process and react to information, too, along with your capacity to draw from your past knowledge and experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Getting physical is also linked to slower age-related cognitive decline, where we gradually lose our thinking, focus and memory skills. “In other words,” says Bohnsack, “if you like where you are, it’s a good idea to continue to exercise because that may at least help you retain your current cognitive function.”\n",
      "\n",
      "4|And though the jury is still out on whether it improves symptoms, exercise may help prevent or delay dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease. For example, one 2017 review in The Journals of Gerontology: Biological Sciences found that activity was associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer’s down the line. The link was strongest for people who purposely exercised in their spare time, rather than those who had physically active jobs. This suggests mental benefits may depend on your chosen activity, in addition to the time you put into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|How does exercise do all this? Scientists aren’t completely sure. It’s thought that working out improves blood flow and oxygen delivery to the brain, helping it function better. Some research indicates it prevents shrinkage of the hippocampus—the part of the brain crucial for learning and remembering things. Experts also believe it stimulates chemical activity in the brain that could contribute to better cognition.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|No matter our age, pretty much all of us can gain from exercise. “There is evidence to suggest that doing more vigorous exercise earlier in life is more beneficial,” says Bohnsack, “but it’s never too late to start because everyone benefits from doing some sort of movement or physical activity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Government exercise guidelines recommend that adults shoot for 150 minutes or more of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity weekly.

By installing such a point mutation in a specific gene, an international research team led by the University of Zurich has succeeded in sustainably lowering high LDL cholesterol levels in the blood of mice and macaques. This opens up the possibility of curing patients with inherited metabolic liver diseases.\n",

      "4|Lipoproteins are complex particles that deliver fat molecules to all tissues of the body through the blood system, supplying energy to the cells. One such lipoprotein, the low-density lipoprotein (LDL), can transport thousands of fat molecules, such as cholesterol, per particle. High levels of LDL in the blood are clinically associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Since LDL can also carry cholesterol into smaller vessels and thus supply more distant tissues, it can increasingly block the artery lumen, which leads to atherosclerosis.\n",

      "2|An international research team led by the University of Zurich (UZH) has now demonstrated that a novel precise gene editing approach can reduce high LDL cholesterol levels -- substantially and sustainably.

      "2|This protein is involved in the uptake of LDL cholesterol from the blood into the cells. \"The genetic change we induced in mice and macaques successfully blocked PCSK9, which led to a significant reduction of the LDL cholesterol concentrations in the blood\n",

      "2|To control the delivery of the base editor tool into the liver of animals, the researchers adapted the RNA technology used in COVID-19 vaccines. However, instead of encapsulating an RNA encoding the spike protein of SARS-CoV2 into lipid nanoparticles, they encapsulated an RNA encoding for the adenine base editor.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The RNA-lipid nanoparticles formulations were introduced into the animals intravenously, leading to liver-specific uptake and transient production of the base editor tool by the cell machinery. \"Up to two-thirds of PCSK9 genes were edited in the mice and up to one-third in the non-human primates, leading to a significant reduction in LDL cholesterol levels,\" says Schwank. In addition, the scientists carefully assessed whether unspecific editing at undesired locations occurred, but found no indications of such off-target events.\n",

      "2|\"Our study shows the feasibility of installing single nucleotide base changes in the liver of non-human primates with high efficiency and accuracy. Approximately 30 percent of all disease-causing hereditary mutations are single base mutations that can, in principle, be corrected with base editors,\" says Schwank\n",

      "2|The new approach could therefore be used to treat a large number of patients suffering from inherited metabolic liver diseases, such as hypercholesterolemia, phenylketonuria or urea cycle disorders.

      "3|Scientists have long perceived that natural selection favors early rising seeds. Seedlings that emerge early in the growing season should have a competitive advantage in monopolizing precious soil resources. Early growth also should mean more access to light, since early growers can block sunlight for seedlings that emerge later in the season.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Research published in the journal Evolution Letters by former UC San Diego graduate student Joseph Waterton and Division of Biological Sciences Professor Elsa Cleland has shown that certain vertebrate herbivores -- including mice, rabbits and birds -- play an underappreciated role in shaping natural selection in plant growth. Due to earlier seasonal growth patterns emerging from climate change, the new findings may factor into evolutionary responses to global environmental changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|\"Germination timing is a really important trait that influences the fitness of plants and their ability to survive and reproduce,\" said Waterton, who received his PhD in Biological Sciences and is now at Indiana University. \"Until this study we didn't understand the role herbivores played in the evolution of this trait -- we had very little idea of what shaped this trait besides aspects of the abiotic environment, such as climate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In field studies using two California grass species, Waterton and Cleland found that early emerging seedlings were more impacted by vertebrate herbivores compared to those that emerged later, likely because they were the first and biggest bits of greenery available on the landscape at the start of the growing season when not much else was growing. They found that such early season consumption by herbivores shrinks the benefit of early seedling emergence.\n",

      "2|Conducted at the UC San Diego Biology Field Station in early 2018, the researchers' study examined native Stipa pulchra and non?native Bromus diandrus grasses, common California grass species with vastly different origins and growth strategies, in neighboring plots that either excluded or allowed access to vertebrate herbivores. Herbivores consistently weakened the success of early emergers in both grass species, the results showed.\n",

      "4|\"Plants that germinate earlier than their neighbors tend to win out. But our study shows that herbivory early in the growing season can counteract the advantage of early germination,\" said Cleland, a professor in the Ecology, Behavior and Evolution Section. \"This is important because in order to persist and keep pace with climate change, many species will need to shift their seasonal timing.

      "3|When scientists hunt for life, they often look for biosignatures, chemicals or phenomena that indicate the existence of present or past life. Yet it isn't necessarily the case that the signs of life on Earth are signs of life in other planetary environments. How do we find life in systems that do not resemble ours?\n",
      "\n",
      "3|In groundbreaking new work, a team* led by Santa Fe Institute Professor Chris Kempes has developed a new ecological biosignature that could help scientists detect life in vastly different environments. Their work appears as part of a special issue of the Bulletin of Mathematical Biology collected in honor of renowned mathematical biologist James D. Murray.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The new research takes its starting point from the idea that stoichiometry, or chemical ratios, can serve as biosignatures. Since \"living systems display strikingly consistent ratios in their chemical make-up,\" Kempes explains, \"we can use stoichiometry to help us detect life.\" Yet, as SFI Science Board member and contributor, Simon Levin, explains, \"the particular elemental ratios we see on Earth are the result of the particular conditions here, and a particular set of macromolecules like proteins and ribosomes, which have their own stoichiometry.\" How can these elemental ratios be generalized beyond the life that we observe on our own planet?\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The group solved this problem by building on two lawlike patterns, two scaling laws, that are entangled in elemental ratios we have observed on Earth. The first of these is that in individual cells, stoichiometry varies with cell size\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In bacteria, for example, as cell size increases, protein concentrations decrease, and RNA concentrations increase. The second is that the abundance of cells in a given environment follows a power-law distribution\n",
      "\n",
      "1|The third, which follows from integrating the first and second into a simple ecological model, is that the elemental abundance of particles to the elemental abundance in the environmental fluid is a function of particle size.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|While the first of these (that elemental ratios shift with particle size) makes for a chemical biosignature, it is the third finding that makes for the new ecological biosignature. If we think of biosignatures not simply in terms of single chemicals or particles, and instead take account of the fluids in which particles appear, we see that the chemical abundances of living systems manifest themselves in mathematical ratios between the particle and environment. These general mathematical patterns may show up in coupled systems that differ significantly from Earth.\n",

      "4|Ultimately, the theoretical framework is designed for application in future planetary missions. \"If we go to an ocean world and look at particles in context with their fluid, we can start to ask whether these particles are exhibiting a power-law that tells us that there is an intentional process, like life, making them,\" explains Heather Graham, Deputy Principal Investigator at NASA's Lab for Agnostic Biosignatures, of which she and Kempes are a part. To take this applied step, however, we need technology to size-sort particles, which, at the moment, we don't have for spaceflight. Yet the theory is ready, and when the technology lands on Earth, we can send it to icy oceans beyond our solar system with a promising new biosignature in hand.\n",

It's a reasonable target that won't break the bank in most years.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Juvenile salmon migrate out to sea in the spring, which was historically a period of high flows in the Sacramento River. Now, however, dams and water diversions combined with seasonal reductions in flows from tributaries result in spring flows that tend to be the lowest of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|\"Because of how we've plumbed the Central Valley, salmon now have to migrate out during low flows. So we're proposing to enact pulse flows in the spring to bring the river up to historical conditions for short periods of time,\" Michel said.\n",

      "2|He noted that plans to implement pulse flows in the Sacramento River are now being developed under environmental permits renegotiated last year for the Central Valley Project, the massive federal water management project that includes the Sacramento River.

      "3|The study identified two other thresholds, defined as \"minimum\" (4,259 cfs) and \"high\" (22,872 cfs). Below the minimum threshold, only 3% of the tagged salmon survived the migration.

      "\n",
      "3|Drastic genetic changes like these are exceptionally rare: The way genes determine sex in mammals has stayed mostly the same for about 180 million years, Roy explains. \"Mammals, with few exceptions, are kind of boring,\" he said. \"Previously we would have thought something like this is impossible.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "2|Since our ancestors infected themselves with retroviruses millions of years ago, we have carried elements of these viruses in our genes -- known as human endogenous retroviruses, or HERVs for short.

The different number of holes make two shapes that are fundamentally, inexorably different.\n",

The threat looms large for food staples of the world such as rice, wheat, potatoes and maize (SN: 9/22/05).

Annually, fungal diseases destroy a third of all harvests and pose a dire threat to global food security.\n",

      "3|Now, a new idea is taking root: Help plants stand their ground by giving them the tools to fight their own battles. A team led by Jason White, an environmental toxicologist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven, is fortifying crops with nutrients fashioned into nanosized packages, which boost plants’ innate immunity against pathogenic fungi more efficiently than traditional plant feeding. Over the past few years, the researchers have devised various nanonutrient concoctions that boost the fungal resistance of soybeans, tomatoes, watermelons and, recently, eggplants, as reported in the April Plant Disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The concept “tackles the challenge at the origin rather than trying to put a Band-Aid on the [problem],” says Leanne Gilbertson, an environmental engineer at the University of Pittsburgh who was not involved in the research. White’s strategy provides plants with the nutrients they need to trigger enzyme production to guard against pathogenic attack. Without any synthetic chemicals introduced, the strategy sidesteps any opportunity for malignant fungi to develop resistances, she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|The researchers’ nanomaterials approach is inspired by their earlier discovery that nanoparticles transported up from the roots of maize can loop back down from the leaves. The researchers dipped half of the root fibers of a single maize plant in a copper nanoparticle formulation and the other half in pure water. The copper showed up in the water-dipped roots, pointing to a roots-to-shoot-to-roots roundtrip, White and his colleagues reported in 2012 in Environmental Science & Technology. That finding suggested that nanoparticles can be applied directly to the leaves in the first place, even when the target destination was the roots.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Using the leaves as an entrance point gets around a perennial problem: Delivering dissolved nutrients through the soil is hardly efficient. Chemicals may break down in the soil, vaporize into the atmosphere or leach away. Only about 20 percent of watered nutrients eventually reach the target areas in a plant. “By using the nanoscale form, we can actually more effectively deliver [nutrients] where we want it and where the plant needs it,” White says.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|To see if this approach could deliver nutrients specifically needed in defense against hostile fungi, White and colleagues carried out tests in eggplants and tomatoes. The team sprayed metallic nanoparticles onto the leaves and shoots of young plants, then infected the plants with pathogenic fungi. The nanoparticle-treated plants had elevated levels of nutritional metals in the roots and higher produce yields compared with the plants fed readily dissolved nutrients, the team reported in 2016 in Environmental Science: Nano.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The nanoparticles weren’t harming the fungi, the researchers found: The fungi still thrived amidst nanoparticles in the environment without the host plant present. Instead, the nanoparticles’ antifungal properties stem from providing plant nourishment — equivalent to humans taking nutritional supplements — that allows plants to mount an appropriate defense on demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|What makes nanonutrients more potent than common fertilizers is the sweet spot in their sizes, which control how fast they dissolve, says Fabienne Schwab, an environmental chemist not involved in the research. Nanonutrients are thousands of times smaller than the diameter of human hair and thousands of times larger than readily dissolved nutrient salts\n",
      "\n",
      "2|They have a large, exposed surface, so they dissolve more quickly than a heftier chunk of the same nutrient. Yet nanonutrients are big enough that that they don’t dissolve all at once: They can gradually release the nutrients over weeks\n",
      "\n",
      "1|In contrast, readily dissolved nutrients give plants a temporary nutrient spike, akin to a sugar rush.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|It’s not just the size that can be tuned — the shape, composition and surface chemistries can be modified to stimulate different levels of a plant’s responses. For instance, White and his collaborators found that nanometer-thin copper oxide sheets were better than spherical copper nanoparticles at preventing Fusarium virguliforme infection in soybeans. The key to their effectiveness lay in the nanosheets’ quicker release of charged copper atoms and stronger adhesion to leaf surfaces. The copper nanomaterials restored the soybean’s masses and photosynthesis rates to the levels of disease-free plants, the team reported in Nature Nanotechnology in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|“It’s a very promising technology,” says Schwab, but she adds that there are other aspects to consider before its implementation. If agricultural nanotechnology is to achieve widespread use, it needs to observe environmental and safety regulations, as well as — perhaps even more challengingly — overcome consumer wariness. So far, White and his collaborators found no residual nanonutrients in their produce that would end up on the dining table of consumers. But other implications, such as the nanomaterials’ persistence in the environment and hazards posed to human handlers, have yet to be fully understood.\n",

      "4|Stirring the film into a toluene solvent first dissolved the polyethylene layer. Dunking the remaining EVOH-PET film in a solvent called DMSO stripped off the EVOH. The researchers then plucked out the remaining PET film and recovered the other two plastics from their separate solvents by mixing in “antisolvent” chemicals. Those chemicals caused the plastic molecules that were dispersed in the liquids to bunch together into solid clumps that could be fished out.\n",

      "3|This process recovered practically all of the plastic from the original film, the researchers reported last November in Science Advances. When tested on a jumble of polyethylene, PET and EVOH beads, the solvent washes recovered more than 95 percent of each material — hinting that these solvents could be used to strip plastic components off bulkier items than packaging films. So in theory, recovery facilities could use this technique to disassemble multiplastic deodorant containers and other products of various shapes and sizes.\n",

      "4|There may also be chemical shortcuts that allow multilayer films and other mixtures of plastics to be recycled as they are. Additives called compatibilizers help different melted-down plastics blend, so that unsorted materials can be treated as one. But there is no universal compatibilizer that allows every kind of plastic to be mixed together. And existing compatibilizers are not widely used because they are not very potent — and adding a lot of compatibilizer to a plastic blend gets expensive.\n",

      "3|For one thing, recycled plastics inherit all the dyes, flame retardants and other additives that gave each original plastic piece its distinctive look and feel. “The plastic that you actually recover at the end of all this is really a very complex mixture,” says chemist Susannah Scott of the University of California, Santa Barbara. Few manufacturers can use plastic with a random mishmash of properties to make something new.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Plus, recycling breaks some of the chemical bonds in plastic molecules, affecting the strength and consistency of the material. Melting down and remolding plastic is sort of like reheating pizza in the microwave — you get out basically what you put in, just not as good. That limits the number of times plastic can be recycled before it has to be landfilled.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The solution to both problems could lie in a new kind of recycling process, called chemical recycling, which promises to make pure new plastic an infinite number of times. Chemical recycling involves taking plastics apart on the molecular level.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The molecules that make up plastics are called polymers, which are made of smaller monomers. Using heat and chemicals, it is possible to disassemble polymers into monomers, separate those building blocks from dyes and other contaminants, and piece the monomers back together into good-as-new plastic.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|“Chemical recycling has really started to emerge as a force, I would say, within the last three or four years,” says University of Pittsburgh’s Beckman. But most chemical recycling techniques are too expensive or energy intensive for commercial use. “It’s not ready for prime time,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Different plastics require different chemical recycling processes, and some break down more easily than others. “The one that’s farthest along is PET,” Beckman says. “That polymer happens to be easy to take apart.” Several companies are developing methods to chemically recycle PET, including the French company Carbios.\n",

      "4|Carbios is testing enzymes produced by microorganisms to break down PET. Researchers at the company described their work on one such enzyme last April in Nature.

To make the enzyme better at snipping apart PET, “we redesigned what we call the active site of the enzyme,” Marty says. This involved swapping out some of the amino acids along that PET docking site for others.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|When the researchers tested their mutant enzyme on colored plastic flakes from PET bottles, applying 3 milligrams of the enzyme per gram of PET, about 90 percent of the plastic broke down in about 10 hours. The original enzyme had maxed out at about 50 percent. Using the terephthalic acid monomers produced in that process, the researchers made new plastic bottles that were just as strong as the originals.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|But other plastics, like polyethylene and polypropylene, are much harder to break down via chemical recycling. Taking apart polyethylene molecules, for instance, requires temperatures over 400° Celsius. At such high heat, the chemistry is chaotic. Plastic molecules break down randomly, generating a complex mixture of compounds that can be burned as fuel but not used to make new materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Scott, the UC Santa Barbara chemist, proposes partially breaking down these sturdy plastics in a more controlled way, under milder conditions, to make other kinds of useful molecules. She and colleagues recently came up with a way to transform polyethylene into alkylaromatic compounds, which can be used as biodegradable ingredients in shampoos, detergents and other products. The process involves placing polyethylene inside a reaction chamber set to 280° C, with a catalyst powder containing platinum nanoparticles.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Polyethylene is a long molecule, in which hydrogen atoms are connected to a carbon backbone that can be thousands of carbon atoms long. The platinum is good at breaking carbon-hydrogen bonds, Scott says. “When you do that, you generate hydrogen in the reactor, and the platinum catalyst can use the hydrogen to break the carbon-carbon bonds [in the molecule backbone]. So it actually chops the chain into smaller pieces.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Since this reaction takes place at a relatively mild 280° C, it happens in an orderly fashion, snapping long polyethylene molecules into shorter chains that are each about 30 carbons long. Those fragments then arrange themselves into the six-sided ring structures characteristic of alkylaromatic compounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|After 24 hours in the reaction chamber, “most of the products are liquids, and most of the liquids are alkylaromatics,” Scott says. In experiments, about 69 percent of the plastic in a low-density polyethylene bag was converted into liquid. About 55 percent of a high-density polyethylene bottle cap was transformed. The process produces hydrocarbon gases too, which could be used to generate heat to run the reaction at a recycling plant, Scott says.\n",

      "4|For now, this is just a lab demo, and like many new recycling strategies, it’s still a long way off from commercialization.

      "2|But instead, the researchers found that the spacing increased. This behavior indicated that the hydrogen atom was shared between the two fluorine atoms equally, rather than being closely bound to one fluorine atom by a covalent bond and more loosely bound by a typical hydrogen bond to the other\n",
      "\n",
      "1|In that arrangement, “the difference between the covalent and [hydrogen] bond is erased and is no longer meaningful,” says study coauthor Bogdan Dereka, a chemist also at the University of Chicago.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Computer calculations showed that this behavior is dependent on the distance between the two fluorine atoms. As the fluorine atoms move closer to each other, squeezing the hydrogen between them, the normal hydrogen bond becomes stronger, until all three atoms begin sharing electrons as in a covalent bond, forming a single link that the researchers call a hydrogen-mediated chemical bond. For fluorine atoms that are farther apart, the conventional description, with distinct covalent and hydrogen bonds, still applies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The hydrogen-mediated chemical bond can’t be described as either a pure hydrogen bond or a pure covalent bond, the researchers conclude. “It’s really some hybrid of the two,” says chemist Mischa Bonn of the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz, Germany, who coauthored a perspective piece on the study, also published in Science.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Hydrogen bonds occur in a variety of substances, most famously in water. Without hydrogen bonds, water at room temperature would be a gas instead of a liquid\n",
      "\n",
      "2|While most hydrogen bonds in water are weak, strong hydrogen bonds similar to the ones found in the bifluoride ions can form in water that contains excess hydrogen ions. Two water molecules can sandwich a hydrogen ion, creating what’s called a Zundel ion, in which the hydrogen ion is equally shared between the two water molecules\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The new results echo the Zundel ion’s behavior, says chemist Erik Nibbering of the Max Born Institute for Nonlinear Optics and Short Pulse Spectroscopy in Berlin, who coauthored a 2017 paper in Science on the Zundel ion. “It all fits nicely.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Strong hydrogen bonds are thought to play a role in transporting hydrogen ions, a process crucial for a variety of biological mechanisms including powering cells and for technologies such as fuel cells. So better understanding these bonds could shed light on a variety of effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|And the new observation has implications for how scientists understand basic principles of chemistry. “It touches on our fundamental understanding of what a chemical bond is,” Bonn says.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|That newfound understanding of chemical bonding also raises questions about what qualifies as a molecule. Atoms connected by covalent bonds are considered part of a single molecule, while those connected by hydrogen bonds can remain separate entities. So bonds in limbo between the two raise the question, “when do you go from two molecules to one molecule?” Tokmakoff says.\n",

      "3|Zinc-air batteries have a lot going for them. They’re lightweight, compact and made of more sustainable, less flammable materials than other batteries. But they’re usually not rechargeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|A new battery design could change that. By tweaking the building materials, researchers created a prototype of a zinc-air battery that could be recharged hundreds of times. Such long-lasting devices, described in the Jan. 1 Science, could one day power electric cars or other electronics.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Zinc-air batteries are one of many potential next-generation batteries that could hold more energy while being cheaper and safer than existing devices (SN: 1/9/17). Every zinc-air battery cell contains two electrodes — a zinc anode and a porous cathode — separated by a liquid called an electrolyte\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In standard zinc-air cells, the electrolyte is a high-pH substance, containing ingredients like potassium hydroxide. Oxygen from the air enters the cathode, where the gas reacts with water from the electrolyte to form hydroxide\n",
      "\n",
      "1|Hydroxide formed at the cathode surface travels to the anode and reacts with zinc to release energy that powers other devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|“The problem is, this reaction is not very reversible,” says Wei Sun, a materials scientist at the University of Münster in Germany. And that makes it hard to recharge the battery. The caustic electrolyte in conventional zinc-air batteries can also degrade the cathode and anode.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|To solve those problems, Sun and colleagues built a zinc-air battery using a new electrolyte that contains water-repellant ions. Those ions stick to the cathode, preventing H 2 O from the electrolyte from reacting with incoming oxygen at the cathode surface. As a result, zinc ions from the anode can travel to the cathode and react directly with oxygen from the air. This relatively simple reaction is easy to run backward to recharge the battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|What’s more, the new electrolyte doesn’t degrade the battery’s electrodes, which helps the battery last longer. In lab experiments, Sun and colleagues were able to drain and recharge a new zinc-air battery cell 320 times over 160 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Today, airplanes pump a lot of climate-warming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. But someday, carbon dioxide sucked from the atmosphere could be used to power airplanes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|A new iron-based catalyst converts carbon dioxide into jet fuel, researchers report online December 22 in Nature Communications. Unlike cars, planes can’t carry batteries big enough to run on electricity from wind or solar power. But if CO 2 , rather than oil, were used to make jet fuel, that could reduce the air travel industry’s carbon footprint — which currently makes up 12 percent of all transportation-related CO 2 emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Past attempts to convert carbon dioxide into fuel have relied on catalysts made of relatively expensive materials, like cobalt, and required multiple chemical processing steps. The new catalyst powder is made of inexpensive ingredients, including iron, and transforms CO 2 in a single step.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|When placed in a reaction chamber with carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas, the catalyst helps carbon from the CO 2 molecules separate from oxygen and link up with hydrogen — forming the hydrocarbon molecules that make up jet fuel. The leftover oxygen atoms from the CO 2 join up with other hydrogen atoms to form water.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Tiancun Xiao, a chemist at the University of Oxford, and colleagues tested their new catalyst on carbon dioxide in a small reaction chamber set to 300° Celsius and pressurized to about 10 times the air pressure at sea level. Over 20 hours, the catalyst converted 38 percent of the carbon dioxide in the chamber into new chemical products. About 48 percent of those products were jet fuel hydrocarbons. Other by-products included similar petrochemicals, such as ethylene and propylene, which can be used to make plastics.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Called the Chilica-pod, the device detects capsaicin, a chemical compound that helps give peppers their sometimes painful kick. In general, the more capsaicin a pepper has, the hotter it tastes. The Chilica-pod is sensitive, capable of detecting extremely low levels of the fiery molecule, researchers report in the Oct. 23 ACS Applied Nano Materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The device could someday be used to test cooked meals or fresh peppers, says analytical chemist Warakorn Limbut of Prince of Songkla University in Hat Yai, Thailand. People with a capsaicin allergy could use the gadget to avoid the compound, or farmers could test harvested peppers to better indicate their spiciness, he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|A portable, chili-shaped gadget determines chili peppers’ spice levels by measuring capsaicin — the fiery molecule that helps give peppers their kick. The “Chilica-pod” is then plugged into a smartphone, where an app analyzes the data. Adapted from ACS Applied Nano Materials 2020\n",
      "\n",
      "2|A pepper’s relative spiciness typically is conveyed in Scoville heat units — an imperfect measurement determined by a panel of human taste testers. Other more precise methods for determining spiciness are time-intensive and involve expensive equipment, making the methods unsuitable for a quick answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "4|Enter the portable, smartphone-compatible Chilica-pod. Built by Limbut and colleagues, the instrument’s sensor is composed of stacks of graphene sheets. When a drop of a chili pepper and ethanol solution is added to the sensor, the capsaicin from the pepper triggers the movement of electrons among the graphene atoms. The more capsaicin the solution has, the stronger the electrical current through the sheets.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The Chilica-pod registers that electrical activity and, once its “stem” is plugged into a smartphone, sends the information to an app for analysis. The device can detect capsaicin levels as low as 0.37 micromoles per liter of solution, equivalent to the amount in a pepper with no heat, one test showed.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Limbut’s team used the Chilica-pod to individually measure six dried chili peppers from a local market. The peppers’ capsaicin concentrations ranged from 7.5 to 90 micromoles per liter of solution, the team found. When translated to Scoville heat units, that range corresponds to the spice of peppers like serrano or cayenne — mild varieties compared to the blazing hot Carolina reaper, one of the world’s hottest peppers (SN: 4/9/18).\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Paul Bosland, a plant geneticist and chili breeder at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces who wasn’t involved in the study, notes that capsaicin is just one of at least 24 related compounds that give peppers heat. “I would hope that [the device] could read them all,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The toxin deltamethrin is used around the world in home sprays and bed nets to curb the spread of mosquito-borne diseases like malaria — which kills over 400,000 people each year, according to the World Health Organization. But “mosquitoes the world over are showing resistance to deltamethrin and [similar] compounds,” says Bart Kahr, a crystallographer at New York University who has helped develop a more potent form of deltamethrin by heating it.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|This form of deltamethrin may stand a better chance of killing insecticide-resistant pests, Kahr and colleagues report online October 12 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Malaria has been essentially eradicated in the United States, but more effective pesticides could be a boon for regions like sub-Saharan Africa, where the disease is a major public health problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Kahr’s team increased the potency of commercial deltamethrin dust spray simply by melting a vial of it — either by heating it to 150° Celsius in an oil bath for five minutes or by popping it in a 700-watt microwave for the same amount of time. While the microscopic deltamethrin crystals in the original spray have a haphazard structure, which looks like a jumble of misaligned flakes, the melted deltamethrin crystals solidified into starburst shapes when they cooled to room temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|The deltamethrin crystals in typical insecticide spray (left microscope image) contain “lots of individual leaflets that are kind of oriented in a helter-skelter manner,” says crystallographer Bart Kahr of New York University. In a new version of the spray, deltamethrin crystals are shaped more like starbursts, with fibers growing out from a single point (right). Jingxiang Yang\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Chemical bonds between deltamethrin molecules in the starburst-shaped crystals are not as strong as those in the original microcrystal structure. “The molecules are intrinsically less happy, or settled, in the arrangement,” Kahr says. So, when a mosquito lands on a dusting of starburst-shaped crystals, it should be easier for deltamethrin molecules to be absorbed into the insect’s body via its feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|The researchers tested the more potent version of deltamethrin on lab-bred mosquitoes from two species: Anopheles quadrimaculatus, which can spread malaria, and Aedes aegypti, which can transmit other life-threatening diseases, such as Zika and dengue (SN: 1/8/19). Forty mosquitoes of each species were released into petri dishes coated in the original deltamethrin dust spray, and another 40 into a dish covered in the new form of the insecticide.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|That altered version of deltamethrin knocked out about half of exposed A. quadrimaculatus mosquitoes within 24 minutes\n",
      "\n",
      "2|In contrast, it took nearly five hours for the original spray to knock out half of exposed Anopheles — about 12 times as long. Likewise, it took only 21 minutes for the new spray to knock out half of exposed A\n",
      "\n",
      "1|aegypti, while it took the original spray over three hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|Although A. quadrimaculatus can carry the parasite that causes malaria, this mosquito species is native to North America, where the disease is not a major public health crisis. To ensure the new type of deltamethrin would be effective in the world’s malarial hot spots, “we need to do these experiments with species called gambiae and funestus, which are the African Anopheles mosquito species,” Kahr says, as well as the six major malaria-spreading Anopheles species in South Asia.\n",
      "\n",
      "3|First, researchers need to test the new version of the insecticide against pesticide-resistant mosquitoes. Mosquito resistance to deltamethrin, along with other chemicals in the class of synthetic pesticides known as pyrethroids, is a growing problem (SN: 6/29/12). “My prediction … is that [the insects] would be highly resistant to both forms,” Hemingway says.\n",
      "\n",
      "2|Researchers also need to ensure that the more toxic form of deltamethrin is safe for people to be around, says Hemingway, who was not involved in the study. “Bottom line — interesting observation, but one that is a good distance from something that could be implemented.”\n",
