history	Shortly after celebrating Rome’s birthday (see here), Hadrian departed on his journey to the northern provinces and began his first extensive voyage through the empire. As he intended to be absent for a considerable time with little idea of the date in return, it was necessary to leave the control of Rome in trustworthy hands. He left Annius Verus, the grandfather of Marcus Aurelius, who was just born (see here), and his friend Turbo to look after the people and the senate.

history	Massilia played a major role in distributing Mediterranean goods along the coast of Gaul and Iberia and into inland Gaul on the rivers Durance and Rhône, relying on a series of trading posts. As Carthage’s rival and Rome longstanding ally, the city thrived by acting as a link between Gaul and Rome’s insatiable need for new products and slaves. It retained its Greek character for a considerable length of time despite the gradual process of romanisation. Its Greek legacy lived on in the urban fabric – complete with a theatre, agora and temples – in its constitution and culture.

history	From Massilia, Hadrian probably sailed north up the Rhône River (Rhodanus) in the direction of Lugdunum. Two years earlier, in 119, the river boatmen of this river, the nautae Rhodanici, had made an offering to Hadrian (see here). They erected a statue of the emperor in the town of Tournus (Tournon-sur-Rhône) between Valencia (Valence) and Vienna (Vienne), at the confluence of the Rhône and the Doux, praising his generosity.	It was the site of an ancient Greek town, providing access to the Mediterranean through the sea of Marmara to the west, the Black Sea to the east, and sitting on the connection point of Rome’s Greek speaking Asian provinces and Latin speaking western provinces. It was, of course, called Constantinopolis (Constantinople).	3	False	non-plagiarism

history	Magic is widely attested in archaeological evidence, spell books and literature from both Greece and Rome, as well as Egypt and the Middle East.

The collection was compiled from sources dating from the second century BC to the fifth century AD, and includes numerous spells of attraction.

history	The best preserved and most notorious magical doll from antiquity, the so-called “Louvre Doll” (4th century AD), depicts a naked female in kneeling position, bound, and pierced with 13 needles. Fashioned from unbaked clay, the doll was found in a terracotta vase in Egypt. The accompanying spell, inscribed on a lead tablet, records the woman’s name as Ptolemais and the man who made the spell, or commissioned a magician to do so, as Sarapammon.	The term “cancel culture” has been widely used in recent years to refer to efforts by both the political left and right to aggressively annul closely held cultural beliefs and even individual personalities by one side or the other.

history	The spells that accompanied such dolls and, indeed, the spells from antiquity on all manner of topics, were not mild in the language and imagery employed. Ancient spells were often violent, brutal and without any sense of caution or remorse. In the spell that comes with the Louvre Doll, the language is both frightening and repellent in a modern context. For example, one part of the spell directed at Ptolemais reads:	Longo, A. and Patrizia Taormina, D.

history	Still magic remains, in part, a mystery when it comes to erotic practice and conventions. The two same-sex spells from the Greek Magical Papyri, for example, attest to the reality of erotic desire among ancient women, but do not shed light on whether this type of sexuality was condoned in Roman Egypt. Perhaps such desires were not socially approved; hence the recourse to magic. Perhaps the desires of Sarapammon for Ptolemais were also outside the bounds of acceptability, which led him to the surreptitious and desperate world of magic.	Shortly after their decision to convert Hagia Sophia from a museum to a mosque, the Turkish authorities issued a vague statement outlining a bizarre plan to cover the mosaics and other Byzantine representational images inside the building with laser light or draperies during Muslim prayers. Based on what the current Turkish government has done with the physical remains of Byzantine heritage thus far, this is surely the next step in a creeping long term plan to “cancel” the remaining vestiges of Byzantium.	4	False	non-plagiarism

history	Huebner made the discovery in the course of an editing project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation. For three years, she has been working with an interdisciplinary team in collaboration with the University of Basel’s Digital Humanities Lab to examine the papyrus collection, which in the meantime has been digitalized, transcribed, annotated and translated. The project team has already presented the history of the papyrus collection through an exhibition in the University Library last year. They plan to publish all their findings at the start of 2019.	The facts of this recent event, which went largely unnoticed by a distracted world, are quickly laid out: In early July of this year, Turkey’s Council of State debated annulment of the 1934 decision to convert Hagia Sophia to a museum. The outcome of this debate was a forgone conclusion, as the Council was packed with loyalists to President Erdogan, the Islamist head of state, who had also served as Prime Minister from 2004-2014. On July 14, the Council voted to proceed and it was announced that the first Islamic prayers would be held inside the building on July 24.

Second, because of disinvestment, the South African economy lost the practical and technical knowhow of the MNCs that was now integral to maintain South African competitiveness.

First, if the MNC's sanctions-busting operation is illegal, government agencies are more likely to uncover and punish conspicuous sanctions-busting trade. Second, even if the MNC's operation is still technically legal due to loopholes, the governments are still more likely to interpret conspicuous sanctions-busting activities as an affront to government authority.The governments will have strong incentives to either amend the sanction legislation, close the loophole, or even resort to extrajudicial measures to punish the ""legal"" trade. While a government might look the other way if an illegal transaction is done under the table, it may be forced to take retaliatory measures if the same trade is done in broad daylight, in open defiance to the authority of the state.27"	Although mistrust in government gave rise to individualism, the economic system that had been put in place was not adequate to support this change in attitude, rendering existing small businesses weak and offering no meaningful path for harnessing the economic benefits of individual entrepreneurship. Three stimulating factors which emphasize the cultural values of equality led to labor reform in pre-war Japan: gender, nationalism and social treatment.[16] Gender played an important role because the gender divide in mill jobs was greater than the class divide.[16] Nationalism had given a feeling of importance to many workers who were eager to give their power for the empire’s success, but bureaucratic regulators and business owners felt the glory was theirs.[16] Finally, Japanese workers felt that their social treatment in the labor system was more important at times than their wages.[16]	4	False	non-plagiarism

As in other historical examples of sanctioning, the population that the sanction was supposed to help suffered the brunt of the economic devastation; ""the median citizen""– the many Africans under Apartheid – experienced even more drastic economic collapse under the sanction regime than did white voters.39 For instance, in companies formerly operated by MNCs before disinvestment, internal corporate regulations that barred discriminatory practices were repealed once each MNC administration was replaced by domestic management. The change in administration exposed the African employees of these companies to even greater discrimination and economic damage.40 Given the severe, short-term economic devastation experienced by Africans, which dwarfed the inconveniences suffered by white voters, if the Africans did have electoral power, there would probably have been an even greater political pressure to end apartheid. If the ""median voter"" did include Africans, Apartheid may have collapsed even sooner under sanctions; but again, there would be no Apartheid if Africans had the vote."

Their most damning evidence came from Rhodesia. Despite the severe embargo, in 1973, eight years into the sanction, Rhodesia's exports grew, GDP rose by seven percent,17 and domestic manufacturing doubled compared to presanction levels.18 The nation also underwent significant political integration as Rhodesians ""rallied to the flag.""19 In South Africa, despite significant movement to disinvest, MNCs maintained an indirect presence in the nation.20 Therefore, capital flight and disinvestment from sanctioned South Africa may not have been as economically devastating as the raw economic figures suggest."	2	False	non-plagiarism

Three stimulating factors which emphasize the cultural values of equality led to labor reform in pre-war Japan: gender, nationalism and social treatment.[16] Gender played an important role because the gender divide in mill jobs was greater than the class divide.[16] Nationalism had given a feeling of importance to many workers who were eager to give their power for the empire’s success, but bureaucratic regulators and business owners felt the glory was theirs.[16] Finally, Japanese workers felt that their social treatment in the labor system was more important at times than their wages.[16]	2	False	non-plagiarism

Furthermore, it is important to verify the performance characteristics of the assays through a validation process that takes into account the analytical features of the assay as well as the clinical sensitivity of the test results [28].	2	False	non-plagiarism

In all the swabs received at the laboratory of our Microbiology Unit, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed using a commercially available one-step real-time PCR (Allplex 2019-nCoV assay, Seegene, Seoul, South Korea) in which, after RNA extraction, retrotranscription and PCR amplification are carried out consecutively in the same reaction tube. This is a qualitative analysis based on the Seegene MuDTTM technology (combining DPOTM and ­TOCETM), which allows identification of multiple Ct values for every pathogen in each channel of the real-time PCR instrument	1	False	non-plagiarism
covid19	Across all the study groups, most infections were asymptomatic, and the incidence of both asymptomatic and symptomatic infections decreased. Nursing homes that were located in counties with the highest incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection had the most incident cases but still had large decreases (Table S2). We observed inconsistent patterns in the incidence of infection among residents relative to rates of vaccination among staff members (Table S3).	In the UK study, risk factors for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies included a nonwhite background, a diagnosis of diabetes, and a history of allograft rejection. The association between ethnicity and diabetes with COVID-19 infection is consistent with risk factors for COVID-19 found in studies within the general population [12, 13] and with prior studies identifying common risk factors for posttransplant infections [14].	3	False	non-plagiarism
covid19	These findings show the real-world effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines in reducing the incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in a vulnerable nursing home population. Our observation of a reduced incidence of infection among unvaccinated residents suggests that robust vaccine coverage among residents and staff, together with the continued use of face masks and other infection-control measures, is likely to afford protection for small numbers of unvaccinated residents in congregate settings. Still, the continued observation of incident cases after vaccination highlights the critical need for ongoing vaccination programs and surveillance testing in nursing homes to mitigate future outbreaks.	Serological assays have been developed using as target the highly antigenic structural proteins spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) of SARS-CoV-2. In most individuals, measurable antibodies develop within days or weeks from symptoms onset [18, 19], thus limiting the use of serological testing in the early phase of infection [20, 21]. However, serological assays are important for contact tracing, for identifying suspected cases who are PCR negative but show radiological findings suggestive of CO­VID-19 [9, 10], to identify asymptomatic carriers [22] or to determine the development of neutralizing antibodies in response to vaccination [23, 24]. Instead, doubts arise about the use of antibody tests for seroprevalence surveys for public health management reasons because the duration of circulating antibody is currently unknown [25].	3	False	non-plagiarism

covid19	Outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in the United States and in European countries in February 2020. Urgent action was called for, since experts estimated that 30 to 70% of people in these Western countries could become infected — a frightening projection at a time when the Covid-19 mortality rate was estimated to be substantially higher than we now know it to be. In March 2020, Michael Ryan, executive director of the Health Emergencies Program of the World Health Organization (WHO), implored countries to act, noting that when it comes to epidemic response, “speed trumps perfection” but “the greatest error is not to move.” At the time, the only tools for containing Covid-19 were social distancing, testing, case isolation, and contact tracing.	Suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections are confirmed after detection of unique and specific target regions within the viral genome. According to the PCR design, the specific target regions may include ORF1ab, RdRp, N, and S genes. In addition, some commercial assays include also the amplification of the common beta coronavirus E gene, which is amplified along with one or more specific target genes. In Table 1 are reported the molecular assays approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (0011715-03/04/2020-DGPRE-DGPRE-P).	3	False	non-plagiarism
covid19	Contact tracing is a crucial public health practice that has been a part of epidemic responses for centuries. From the bubonic plague, to smallpox and tuberculosis, to HIV, the fate of public health has relied on our ability to identify people who have been in contact with infected people	In our case history, the time to viral clearance was moderately longer in patients with metabolic decompensation during infection, but we did not find significant differences between 3 groups of patients.

Similarly, in transplant patients, no correlation with the immunosuppression regimen was possible.	2	False	non-plagiarism

covid19	In most Western countries, no such effort to enhance contact tracing using automation was implemented early in the epidemic. Without prior experience in responding to epidemics in this way, many leaders and citizens found it inconceivable that personal privacy and data protection rights could be ceded to health protection. Yet the fact that many people in Western countries already permit collection of geolocation data by other apps that provide little personal benefit suggests that the resistance to doing so for health protection, while well intended, may have been misguided.2	Serological semiquantitative determinations of IgG and IgM were carried out in a time span ranging from 3 to 8 days following negativization.	3	False	non-plagiarism

covid19	Challenges remain, however. Integration of digital contact-tracing technologies with existing test-and-trace systems appears to be an important determinant of their utility.5 More importantly, digital contact-tracing technologies must be made accessible, particularly to people with limited access to smartphone technology, those with limited digital health literacy, speakers of languages other than a country’s primary language, and migrant communities. Increasing accessibility is important not only for maximizing uptake, but also for ensuring that all members of society can benefit equitably from digital advances in contact tracing. If these challenges can be overcome, Western countries will have gained a trustworthy, privacy-preserving, accessible tool to use during the next pandemic to enhance contact-tracing capacity and control disease spread until elimination is achieved.

Although these findings indicate that the booster response was more efficacious when the vaccine was administered more than 3 months after infection, not enough information is available to draw a definitive conclusion.	Immunosuppression is a major risk factor for opportunistic infections [1]. Therefore, since the very beginning of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, kidney transplant recipients have been considered a fragile population at higher risk of infection and poor outcomes [2, 3]. Finding that the most common risk factors for mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), such as older age, diabetes, and hypertension, are also common in transplanted individuals further supported this notion.	2	False	non-plagiarism
covid19	The most remarkable finding of this study was the significantly lower neutralizing antibody titer after administration of a second dose of vaccine in previously uninfected patients than the titer after only a single dose of vaccine in previously infected participants. It is unclear how the neutralizing antibody titers influence the ability of the host to transmit the virus. These findings provide evidence that after the administration of a single dose of vaccine, the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 in persons with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection is greater than the response in previously uninfected participants who have received a second dose.	The need for remote monitoring of graft function has further highlighted the importance of noninvasive biomarkers of acute rejection. Despite the approval by the Food and Drug Administration of a few assays, this still largely represents an unmet need that should also be adequately addressed in the post-COVID-19 period of transplant medicine.	3	False	non-plagiarism

No symptomatic infections and only two PCR-positive results in asymptomatic health care workers were seen in those with anti-spike antibodies, which suggests that previous infection resulting in antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is associated with protection from reinfection for most people for at least 6 months. Evidence of postinfection immunity was also seen when anti-nucleocapsid IgG or the combination of anti-nucleocapsid and anti-spike IgG was used as a marker of previous infection.

covid19	The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was inversely associated with baseline anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid antibody titers, including titers below the positive threshold for both assays, such that workers with high “negative” titers were relatively protected from infection. In addition to the 24 seronegative health care workers with a previous positive PCR test, it is likely that other health care workers with baseline titers below assay thresholds, which were set to ensure high specificity,23 had been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and had low peak postinfection titers or rising or waning responses at testing.5	There was an urgent need to augment the scale and rapidity of contact tracing to identify everyone who had been exposed to Covid-19.	2	False	non-plagiarism

These results could be consistent with a reexposure to SARS-CoV-2 that did not lead to symptoms but could also plausibly have arisen from undetected laboratory error; although contemporaneous retesting of the PCR-positive sample was not undertaken, samples tested 2 and 4 days later were both negative	There was also a different diagnostic approach to the infection in the 3 study groups; among hemodialysis patients, the diagnosis was occasional in 10% of them during the screening for procedure execution not related to COVID-19 (preparation for instrumental examinations and scheduled hospitalizations) and in 15% for reporting contacts with positive cases.

covid19	The overall mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Italy was 11.6%; a worse outcome is reported in patients with chronic diseases and cardiovascular comorbidity [28]. Consistent with previous reports [24, 25], our population showed an elevated death rate (22.2% in patients with decompensated renal failure, 38.0% in dialysis patients, and 31.2% in transplant recipients), confirming the fragility of chronic nephropathic patients, in spite of the timely therapy against COVID-19 given in most of the cases and the reduction of immunosuppression in transplanted patients. Sadly, the work suffers from the heterogeneity of therapeutic intervention for COVID-19, mainly related to the period in which the study was conducted, the early stages of the pandemic outbreak in Italy, when a reference treatment scheme was not well defined yet.	Considering that transplant recipients were advised to shield in the UK months earlier than the general population and their generally more cautious attitude to limit exposure to infections, the authors of the study predicted a much lower exposure rate. However, the fact that family members may not always be as careful as the transplant recipients makes this conclusion hard to substantiate.	3	False	non-plagiarism

The anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies measured in the UK study were targeted against the RBD viral antigen [10].

Therefore, the rejection-associated risk could be driven by the use of steroids due to a prior episode, similar to the results of studies in other immunosuppressed populations, suggesting that glucocorticoid exposure increases the risk of severe COVID-19 disease [15]	In most Western countries, no such effort to enhance contact tracing using automation was implemented early in the epidemic. Without prior experience in responding to epidemics in this way, many leaders and citizens found it inconceivable that personal privacy and data protection rights could be ceded to health protection. Yet the fact that many people in Western countries already permit collection of geolocation data by other apps that provide little personal benefit suggests that the resistance to doing so for health protection, while well intended, may have been misguided.2	2	False	non-plagiarism

covid19	The anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies measured in the UK study were targeted against the RBD viral antigen [10]. There is evidence that anti-RBD antibodies may provide information on functional immunity, given reported correlations between RBD antibodies and neutralizing antibodies [17, 18]. However, ad hoc functional studies testing the viral-neutralizing capacity of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies produced by transplant recipients are needed. Understanding the antiviral response in kidney transplant recipients is key not just to interpret data of antibody screening studies but more importantly to manage immunosuppression during COVID-19 and for future vaccine strategies.	Initial series of hospitalized kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 showed alarming rates of mortality, between 25 and 35% [4]. These rates are higher than in-hospital case-fatality rates reported in the general population (ranging between 10 and 20%) [5-7]. However, there are also series showing that solid organ recipients have similar COVID-19-related mortality rates than the general population [8]. This suggests that such increased risk might be mitigated, for instance, by early hospitalization and a greater ease of access to intensive care unit [8].	4	False	non-plagiarism

Climate research is made difficult by the large scale, long time periods, and complex processes which govern climate. Climate is governed by physical laws which can be expressed as differential equations. These equations are coupled and nonlinear, so that approximate solutions are obtained by using numerical methods to create global climate models. Climate is sometimes modeled as a stochastic process but this is generally accepted as an approximation to processes that are otherwise too complicated to analyze.	4	False	non-plagiarism

From 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface was observed, a phenomenon popularly known as global dimming, typically attributed to aerosols from biofuel and fossil fuel burning. Aerosol removal by precipitation gives tropospheric aerosols an atmospheric lifetime of only about a week, while stratospheric aerosols can remain in the atmosphere for a few years. Globally, aerosols have been declining since 1990, meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much.

technology	“I realized the critical issue was power,” says Néstor O. Pérez-Arancibia. His team at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles turned to methanol because in a given mass, it packs over 10 times the energy as tiny batteries.	"In the latest study, however, the researchers decided to add two insulators to their devices, not just one. That addition had the counterintuitive effect of creating an energetic phenomenon called a quantum ""well."" If electrons hit this well with just the right energy, they can use it to tunnel through the two insulators -- experiencing no resistance in the process. It's not unlike a ghost drifting through a wall unperturbed. A graduate student in Moddel's research group had previously theorized that such spectral behavior could be possible in optical rectennas, but, until now, no one had been able to prove it."	3	False	non-plagiarism

health	When it was found that psychoactive drugs affect neurotransmitter levels in the brain, as evidenced mainly by the levels of their breakdown products in the spinal fluid, the theory arose that the cause of mental illness is an abnormality in the brain’s concentration of these chemicals that is specifically countered by the appropriate drug. For example, because Thorazine was found to lower dopamine levels in the brain, it was postulated that psychoses like schizophrenia are caused by too much dopamine. Or later, because certain antidepressants increase levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain, it was postulated that depression is caused by too little serotonin. (These antidepressants, like Prozac or Celexa, are called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) because they prevent the reabsorption of serotonin by the neurons that release it, so that more remains in the synapses to activate other neurons.) Thus, instead of developing a drug to treat an abnormality, an abnormality was postulated to fit a drug.

In his earlier study and in work by others, he observed that even treatments that were not considered to be antidepressants—such as synthetic thyroid hormone, opiates, sedatives, stimulants, and some herbal remedies—were as effective as antidepressants in alleviating the symptoms of depression. Kirsch writes, “When administered as antidepressants, drugs that increase, decrease or have no effect on serotonin all relieve depression to about the same degree.” What all these “effective” drugs had in common was that they produced side effects, which participating patients had been told they might experience.	Kirsch was also struck by another unexpected finding	3	True	partial literal
health	It is important that clinical trials, particularly those dealing with subjective conditions like depression, remain double-blind, with neither patients nor doctors knowing whether or not they are getting a placebo. That prevents both patients and doctors from imagining improvements that are not there, something that is more likely if they believe the agent being administered is an active drug instead of a placebo. Faced with his findings that nearly any pill with side effects was slightly more effective in treating depression than an inert placebo, Kirsch speculated that the presence of side effects in individuals receiving drugs enabled them to guess correctly that they were getting active treatment—and this was borne out by interviews with patients and doctors—which made them more likely to report improvement. He suggests that the reason antidepressants appear to work better in relieving severe depression than in less severe cases is that patients with severe symptoms are likely to be on higher doses and therefore experience more side effects.

health	If psychoactive drugs do cause harm, as Whitaker contends, what is the mechanism? The answer, he believes, lies in their effects on neurotransmitters.

health	The same is true for drugs that block neurotransmitters, except in reverse.

health	With long-term use of psychoactive drugs, the result is, in the words of Steve Hyman, a former director of the NIMH and until recently provost of Harvard University, “substantial and long-lasting alterations in neural function.” As quoted by Whitaker, the brain, Hyman wrote, begins to function in a manner “qualitatively as well as quantitatively different from the normal state.” After several weeks on psychoactive drugs, the brain’s compensatory efforts begin to fail, and side effects emerge that reflect the mechanism of action of the drugs. For example, the SSRIs may cause episodes of mania, because of the excess of serotonin	Getting off the drugs is exceedingly difficult, according to Whitaker, because when they are withdrawn the compensatory mechanisms are left unopposed. When Celexa is withdrawn, serotonin levels fall precipitously because the presynaptic neurons are not releasing normal amounts and the postsynaptic neurons no longer have enough receptors for it. Similarly, when an antipsychotic is withdrawn, dopamine levels may skyrocket. The symptoms produced by withdrawing psychoactive drugs are often confused with relapses of the original disorder, which can lead psychiatrists to resume drug treatment, perhaps at higher doses.	2	False	non-plagiarism

health	Unlike the cool Kirsch, Whitaker is outraged by what he sees as an iatrogenic (i.e., inadvertent and medically introduced) epidemic of brain dysfunction, particularly that caused by the widespread use of the newer (“atypical”) antipsychotics, such as Zyprexa, which cause serious side effects. Here is what he calls his “quick thought experiment”:	It is important that clinical trials, particularly those dealing with subjective conditions like depression, remain double-blind, with neither patients nor doctors knowing whether or not they are getting a placebo. That prevents both patients and doctors from imagining improvements that are not there, something that is more likely if they believe the agent being administered is an active drug instead of a placebo. Faced with his findings that nearly any pill with side effects was slightly more effective in treating depression than an inert placebo, Kirsch speculated that the presence of side effects in individuals receiving drugs enabled them to guess correctly that they were getting active treatment—and this was borne out by interviews with patients and doctors—which made them more likely to report improvement. He suggests that the reason antidepressants appear to work better in relieving severe depression than in less severe cases is that patients with severe symptoms are likely to be on higher doses and therefore experience more side effects.	2	False	non-plagiarism

It was an American agricultural chemist, Wilbur Atwater, who popularised the idea that it could be used to measure both the energy contained in food and the energy the body expended on things like muscular work, tissue repair and powering the organs. In 1887, after a trip to Germany, he wrote a series of wildly popular articles in Century, an American magazine, suggesting that “food is to the body what fuel is to the fire.” He introduced the public to the notion of “macronutrients” – carbohydrates, protein and fat – so called because the body needs a lot of them.

chemistry	Chances are, most — if not all — of the produce in your kitchen is threatened by fungal diseases. The threat looms large for food staples of the world such as rice, wheat, potatoes and maize (SN: 9/22/05). Pathogenic fungi are also coming for our coffee, sugarcane, bananas and other economically important crops. Annually, fungal diseases destroy a third of all harvests and pose a dire threat to global food security.	Hydrogen bonds are typically thought of as weak electrical attractions rather than true chemical bonds. Covalent bonds, on the other hand, are strong chemical bonds that hold together atoms within a molecule and result from electrons being shared among atoms. Now, researchers report that an unusually strong variety of hydrogen bond is in fact a hybrid, as it involves shared electrons, blurring the distinction between hydrogen and covalent bonds.	4	False	non-plagiarism

A team led by Jason White, an environmental toxicologist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven, is fortifying crops with nutrients fashioned into nanosized packages, which boost plants’ innate immunity against pathogenic fungi more efficiently than traditional plant feeding. Over the past few years, the researchers have devised various nanonutrient concoctions that boost the fungal resistance of soybeans, tomatoes, watermelons and, recently, eggplants, as reported in the April Plant Disease.	Polyethylene is a long molecule, in which hydrogen atoms are connected to a carbon backbone that can be thousands of carbon atoms long.

chemistry	The researchers’ nanomaterials approach is inspired by their earlier discovery that nanoparticles transported up from the roots of maize can loop back down from the leaves. The researchers dipped half of the root fibers of a single maize plant in a copper nanoparticle formulation and the other half in pure water. The copper showed up in the water-dipped roots, pointing to a roots-to-shoot-to-roots roundtrip, White and his colleagues reported in 2012 in Environmental Science & Technology. That finding suggested that nanoparticles can be applied directly to the leaves in the first place, even when the target destination was the roots.	This form of deltamethrin may stand a better chance of killing insecticide-resistant pests, Kahr and colleagues report online October 12 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

So far, White and his collaborators found no residual nanonutrients in their produce that would end up on the dining table of consumers. But other implications, such as the nanomaterials’ persistence in the environment and hazards posed to human handlers, have yet to be fully understood.	Chemical bonds between deltamethrin molecules in the starburst-shaped crystals are not as strong as those in the original microcrystal structure. “The molecules are intrinsically less happy, or settled, in the arrangement,” Kahr says.

Different plastics require different chemical recycling processes, and some break down more easily than others. “The one that’s farthest along is PET,” Beckman says. “That polymer happens to be easy to take apart.” Several companies are developing methods to chemically recycle PET, including the French company Carbios.	4	False	non-plagiarism

chemistry	Having two polyethylene and two polypropylene connectors for each compatibilizer molecule, rather than one, made this compatibilizer stronger than previous versions, Coates and colleagues reported in 2017 in Science. The first test of the new compatibilizer involved welding together strips of polyethylene and polypropylene. Ordinarily, the two materials easily peel apart. But with a layer of compatibilizer between them, the plastic strips broke, rather than the compatibilizer seal, when pulled apart.	“Our understanding of chemical bonding, the way we teach it, is very much black and white,” says chemist Andrei Tokmakoff of the University of Chicago.

chemistry	Even if every piece of plastic trash could easily be recycled, that still wouldn’t solve the world’s plastic problem. There are a couple major issues with how recycling currently works that severely limit the usability of recycled materials.	After 24 hours in the reaction chamber, “most of the products are liquids, and most of the liquids are alkylaromatics,” Scott says. In experiments, about 69 percent of the plastic in a low-density polyethylene bag was converted into liquid. About 55 percent of a high-density polyethylene bottle cap was transformed. The process produces hydrocarbon gases too, which could be used to generate heat to run the reaction at a recycling plant, Scott says.	2	False	non-plagiarism

People with allergic kapsaicin can use gadgets to avoid complexes, or farmers can test the peppers harvested to better show their suppression, he said. 	2	True	paraphrase
chemistry	A portable, chili-shaped gadget determines chili peppers’ spice levels by measuring capsaicin — the fiery molecule that helps give peppers their kick. The “Chilica-pod” is then plugged into a smartphone, where an app analyzes the data. Adapted from ACS Applied Nano Materials 2020	That newfound understanding of chemical bonding also raises questions about what qualifies as a molecule. Atoms connected by covalent bonds are considered part of a single molecule, while those connected by hydrogen bonds can remain separate entities. So bonds in limbo between the two raise the question, “when do you go from two molecules to one molecule?” Tokmakoff says.	3	False	non-plagiarism

chemistry	Enter the portable, smartphone-compatible Chilica-pod. Built by Limbut and colleagues, the instrument’s sensor is composed of stacks of graphene sheets. When a drop of a chili pepper and ethanol solution is added to the sensor, the capsaicin from the pepper triggers the movement of electrons among the graphene atoms. The more capsaicin the solution has, the stronger the electrical current through the sheets.	come in the take-away smartphone-compatible Chilica-pod collective by Limbut and colleagues the instrument’s detector is composed of stacks of graphene sheets When A cliff of a chili con carne common pepper and ethanol resolution is added to the sensor the capsaicin from the pepper triggers the motion of electrons among the graphene atoms The Thomas More capsaicin the solution has the stronger the electric on-going direct the sheets 	4	True	structural change

chemistry	Limbut’s team used the Chilica-pod to individually measure six dried chili peppers from a local market. The peppers’ capsaicin concentrations ranged from 7.5 to 90 micromoles per liter of solution, the team found. When translated to Scoville heat units, that range corresponds to the spice of peppers like serrano or cayenne — mild varieties compared to the blazing hot Carolina reaper, one of the world’s hottest peppers (SN: 4/9/18).

chemistry	The toxin deltamethrin is used around the world in home sprays and bed nets to curb the spread of mosquito-borne diseases like malaria — which kills over 400,000 people each year, according to the World Health Organization. But “mosquitoes the world over are showing resistance to deltamethrin and [similar] compounds,” says Bart Kahr, a crystallographer at New York University who has helped develop a more potent form of deltamethrin by heating it.	One of the biggest bottlenecks in plastic recycling is that every material has to get processed separately. “Most plastics are like oil and water,” says chemist Geoffrey Coates of Cornell University	2	False	non-plagiarism
chemistry	This form of deltamethrin may stand a better chance of killing insecticide-resistant pests, Kahr and colleagues report online October 12 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

chemistry	Kahr’s team increased the potency of commercial deltamethrin dust spray simply by melting a vial of it — either by heating it to 150° Celsius in an oil bath for five minutes or by popping it in a 700-watt microwave for the same amount of time. While the microscopic deltamethrin crystals in the original spray have a haphazard structure, which looks like a jumble of misaligned flakes, the melted deltamethrin crystals solidified into starburst shapes when they cooled to room temperature.

chemistry	The deltamethrin crystals in typical insecticide spray (left microscope image) contain “lots of individual leaflets that are kind of oriented in a helter-skelter manner,” says crystallographer Bart Kahr of New York University. In a new version of the spray, deltamethrin crystals are shaped more like starbursts, with fibers growing out from a single point (right).

chemistry	Chemical bonds between deltamethrin molecules in the starburst-shaped crystals are not as strong as those in the original microcrystal structure. “The molecules are intrinsically less happy, or settled, in the arrangement,” Kahr says. So, when a mosquito lands on a dusting of starburst-shaped crystals, it should be easier for deltamethrin molecules to be absorbed into the insect’s body via its feet.	Plus, recycling breaks some of the chemical bonds in plastic molecules, affecting the strength and consistency of the material. Melting down and remolding plastic is sort of like reheating pizza in the microwave — you get out basically what you put in, just not as good. That limits the number of times plastic can be recycled before it has to be landfilled.	3	False	non-plagiarism
chemistry	The researchers tested the more potent version of deltamethrin on lab-bred mosquitoes from two species: Anopheles quadrimaculatus, which can spread malaria, and Aedes aegypti, which can transmit other life-threatening diseases, such as Zika and dengue (SN: 1/8/19). Forty mosquitoes of each species were released into petri dishes coated in the original deltamethrin dust spray, and another 40 into a dish covered in the new form of the insecticide.

chemistry	Although A. quadrimaculatus can carry the parasite that causes malaria, this mosquito species is native to North America, where the disease is not a major public health crisis. To ensure the new type of deltamethrin would be effective in the world’s malarial hot spots, “we need to do these experiments with species called gambiae and funestus, which are the African Anopheles mosquito species,” Kahr says, as well as the six major malaria-spreading Anopheles species in South Asia.	“There’s not going to be a single technology that’s going to be the answer,” says Ed Daniels, senior project manager at the REMADE Institute in West Henrietta, N.Y., which funds research into new recycling techniques. Some projects are on the brink of breaking into industry; others are still just promising lab experiments. But all are focused on designing a future where any plastic that ends up in the recycling bin can have a second and third life in a new product.	3	False	non-plagiarism
chemistry	First, researchers need to test the new version of the insecticide against pesticide-resistant mosquitoes. Mosquito resistance to deltamethrin, along with other chemicals in the class of synthetic pesticides known as pyrethroids, is a growing problem (SN: 6/29/12). “My prediction … is that [the insects] would be highly resistant to both forms,” Hemingway says.

If agricultural nanotechnology is to achieve widespread use, it needs to observe environmental and safety regulations, as well as — perhaps even more challengingly — overcome consumer wariness. So far, White and his collaborators found no residual nanonutrients in their produce that would end up on the dining table of consumers. But other implications, such as the nanomaterials’ persistence in the environment and hazards posed to human handlers, have yet to be fully understood.	2	False	non-plagiarism
