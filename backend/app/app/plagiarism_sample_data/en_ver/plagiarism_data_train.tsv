covid19	The most remarkable finding of this study was the significantly lower neutralizing antibody titer after administration of a second dose of vaccine in previously uninfected patients than the titer after only a single dose of vaccine in previously infected participants. It is unclear how the neutralizing antibody titers influence the ability of the host to transmit the virus. These findings provide evidence that after the administration of a single dose of vaccine, the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 in persons with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection is greater than the response in previously uninfected participants who have received a second dose.	The need for remote monitoring of graft function has further highlighted the importance of noninvasive biomarkers of acute rejection. Despite the approval by the Food and Drug Administration of a few assays, this still largely represents an unmet need that should also be adequately addressed in the post-COVID-19 period of transplant medicine.	3	False	non-plagiarism	remark find significantli lower neutral antibodi titer administr second dose vaccin previous uninfect titer singl dose vaccin previous infect particip unclear neutral antibodi titer influenc abil host transmit viru find provid evid administr singl dose vaccin humor respons sars-cov-2 person histori sars-cov-2 greater respons previous uninfect particip receiv second dose	need remot monitor graft function highlight import noninvas biomark acut reject despit approv food drug administr assay still larg repres unmet need also adequ address post-covid-19 period transplant medicin

Consequently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines on transmission-based precautions for immunocompromised patients are based on limited data.2	Laboratory diagnostic assays are key for a proper management of COVID-19 patients and for limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

chemistry	There may also be chemical shortcuts that allow multilayer films and other mixtures of plastics to be recycled as they are. Additives called compatibilizers help different melted-down plastics blend, so that unsorted materials can be treated as one. But there is no universal compatibilizer that allows every kind of plastic to be mixed together. And existing compatibilizers are not widely used because they are not very potent — and adding a lot of compatibilizer to a plastic blend gets expensive.	Different plastics require different chemical recycling processes, and some break down more easily than others. “The one that’s farthest along is PET,” Beckman says. “That polymer happens to be easy to take apart.” Several companies are developing methods to chemically recycle PET, including the French company Carbios.	4	False	non-plagiarism	may also chemic shortcut allow multilay film mixtur recycl addit call compatibil help differ melted-down blend unsort materi treat one univers compatibil allow everi kind mix togeth exist compatibil wide use potent ad lot compatibil blend get expens	differ requir differ chemic recycl process break easili one farthest along pet beckman polym happen easi take apart sever compani develop method chemic recycl pet includ french compani carbio

environment	An important method of waste management is the prevention of waste material being created, also known as waste reduction. Waste Minimization is reducing the quantity of hazardous wastes achieved through a thorough application of innovative or alternative procedures. Methods of avoidance include reuse of second-hand products, repairing broken items instead of buying new ones, designing products to be refillable or reusable (such as cotton instead of plastic shopping bags), encouraging consumers to avoid using disposable products (such as disposable cutlery), removing any food/liquid remains from cans and packaging, and designing products that use less material to achieve the same purpose (for example, lightweighting of beverage cans).	A diverse variety of living organisms (life forms) can be found in the biosphere on Earth, and properties common to these organisms—plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria—are a carbon- and water-based cellular form with complex organization and heritable genetic information. Living organisms undergo metabolism, maintain homeostasis, possess a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, reproduce and, through natural selection, adapt to their environment in successive generations. More complex living organisms can communicate through various means.	3	False	non-plagiarism	import method manag prevent materi creat also known reduct minim reduc quantiti hazard wast achiev thorough applic innov altern procedur method avoid includ reus second-hand product repair broken item instead buy one design product refil reusabl cotton instead shop bag encourag consum avoid use dispos product dispos cutleri remov food liquid remain packag design product use less materi achiev purpos exampl lightweight beverag	divers varieti live organ life form found biospher earth properti common organismspl anim fungi protist archaea bacteriaar carbon- water-bas cellular form complex organ herit genet inform live organ undergo metabol maintain homeostasi possess capac grow respond stimuli reproduc natur select adapt environ success gener complex live organ commun variou mean

This is consistent with previous research that has found a robust correlation between ECI and GDP per capita.

Nurses assessed residents daily and documented new symptoms in structured change-in-condition notes	Real-time PCR assays represent the gold standard for the laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, false-negative results may occur. Several factors may be responsible for these incorrect results: quality of the specimen, viral load below the limit of detection (LOD) of the method, incorrect handling of the specimen, problems during shipment, timing of sampling (sample collected too early or too late during infection), and source of sample (upper or lower respiratory tract). In the initial phase of COVID-19 disease, upper respiratory tract sample can result in RT-PCR negative, while chest computed tomography images show the presence of pulmonary abnormalities consistent with viral pneumonia [9-11].

geography	In the United States the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 set forth requirements for analysis of federal government actions (such as highway construction projects and land management decisions) in terms of specific environmental criteria. Numerous state laws have echoed these mandates, applying the principles to local-scale actions. The upshot has been an explosion of documentation and study of environmental consequences before the fact of development actions.

Obviously, if the United States restricts access to its market, then the sanction would be much more effective than if the United States did not. The depth of a sanction package is the number of commodities sanctioned. In 1983, Australia refused to sell uranium to France; while the sanction did some harm to the French nuclear program, it had little impact on the health of the macroeconomy.8 If Australia had restricted French access to its entire market, the French economy would have been more acutely hurt.	some other equally intuitive exercise will prove the breadth and astuteness of the sanction package 7 The comprehensiveness of a O.K. bundle is the proportionality of the global market that would participate in the sanction evidently if the United States restricts accession to its grocery store past the authorization would be more to a greater extent effective than if the United States did non The profundity of a sanction software is the count of commodities ratified In 1983 Australia refused to sell uranium to France while the authorisation did some harm to the French cell organelle plan it had lowercase impact on the health of the macroeconomy 8 If Australia had restricted French access to its smooth grocery store the French economic system would have been more astutely hurt 	4	True	structural change	anoth equal intuit exercis examin breadth depth sanction packag 7 breadth sanction packag proport global market would particip sanction obvious unit state restrict access market sanction would much effect unit state depth sanction packag number commod sanction 1983 australia refus sell uranium franc sanction harm french nuclear program littl impact health macroeconomi 8 australia restrict french access entir market french economi would acut hurt	equal intuit exercis prove breadth astut sanction packag 7 comprehens k bundl proportion global market would particip sanction evid unit state restrict access groceri store past author would greater extent effect unit state non profund sanction softwar count commod ratifi 1983 australia refus sell uranium franc authoris harm french cell organel plan lowercas impact health macroeconomi 8 australia restrict french access smooth groceri store french system would astut hurt

health	Someone with asthma may develop sensitivities to things around them, which can trigger asthma symptoms or attacks. During an asthma attack, the muscles around the airways contract, reducing a person’s ability to breathe properly and causing symptoms like coughing and wheezing.	That may not sound like much, but a recent study by the Los Angeles Times indicates that the impact can be devastating. The Times found that even though only about 2 percent of California's kindergartners are unvaccinated (10,000 kids, or about twice the number as in 1997), they tend to be clustered, disproportionately increasing the risk of an outbreak of such largely eradicated diseases as measles, mumps, and pertussis (whooping cough). The clustering means almost 10 percent of elementary schools statewide may already be at risk.	2	False	non-plagiarism	someon asthma may develop sensit thing around trigger asthma symptom attack asthma attack muscl around airway contract reduc person abil breath properli caus symptom like cough wheez	may sound like much recent lo angel time indic impact devast time found even though 2 percent california kindergartn unvaccin 10 000 kid twice number 1997 tend cluster disproportion increas risk outbreak larg erad diseas measl mump pertussi whoop cough cluster mean almost 10 percent elementari school statewid may alreadi risk

One such lipoprotein, the low-density lipoprotein (LDL), can transport thousands of fat molecules, such as cholesterol, per particle.

covid19	These findings show the real-world effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines in reducing the incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in a vulnerable nursing home population. Our observation of a reduced incidence of infection among unvaccinated residents suggests that robust vaccine coverage among residents and staff, together with the continued use of face masks and other infection-control measures, is likely to afford protection for small numbers of unvaccinated residents in congregate settings. Still, the continued observation of incident cases after vaccination highlights the critical need for ongoing vaccination programs and surveillance testing in nursing homes to mitigate future outbreaks.	Serological assays have been developed using as target the highly antigenic structural proteins spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) of SARS-CoV-2. In most individuals, measurable antibodies develop within days or weeks from symptoms onset [18, 19], thus limiting the use of serological testing in the early phase of infection [20, 21]. However, serological assays are important for contact tracing, for identifying suspected cases who are PCR negative but show radiological findings suggestive of CO­VID-19 [9, 10], to identify asymptomatic carriers [22] or to determine the development of neutralizing antibodies in response to vaccination [23, 24]. Instead, doubts arise about the use of antibody tests for seroprevalence surveys for public health management reasons because the duration of circulating antibody is currently unknown [25].	3	False	non-plagiarism	find show real-world effect mrna vaccin reduc incid asymptomat symptomat sars-cov-2 infect vulner nurs home popul observ reduc incid among unvaccin resid suggest robust vaccin coverag among resid staff togeth continu use face mask infection-control measur like afford protect small number unvaccin resid congreg set still continu observ incid case vaccin highlight critic need ongo vaccin program surveil test nurs home mitig futur outbreak	serolog assay develop use target highli antigen structur protein spike nucleocapsid n sars-cov-2 individu measur antibodi develop within day week symptom onset 18 thu limit use serolog test earli phase 20 21 howev serolog assay import contact trace identifi suspect case pcr neg show radiolog find suggest covid-19 9 10 identifi asymptomat carrier 22 determin develop neutral antibodi respons vaccin 23 24 instead doubt aris use antibodi test seropreval survey public health manag reason durat circul antibodi current unknown 25

The outcome of this debate was a forgone conclusion, as the Council was packed with loyalists to President Erdogan, the Islamist head of state, who had also served as Prime Minister from 2004-2014. On July 14, the Council voted to proceed and it was announced that the first Islamic prayers would be held inside the building on July 24. The screen capture below, from the Turkish government’s website, shows how quickly this decision was implemented.

Climate change concerns and increasing in green jobs, coupled with high oil prices, peak oil, oil wars, oil spills, promotion of electric vehicles and renewable electricity, nuclear disasters and increasing government support, are driving increasing renewable energy legislation, incentives and commercialization. New government spending, regulation and policies helped the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis better than many other sectors.	Further evidence for greenhouse gases being the cause of recent climate change come from measurements showing the warming of the lower atmosphere (the troposphere), coupled with the cooling of the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere).

environment	Plant energy is produced by crops specifically grown for use as fuel that offer high biomass output per hectare with low input energy. The grain can be used for liquid transportation fuels while the straw can be burned to produce heat or electricity. Plant biomass can also be degraded from cellulose to glucose through a series of chemical treatments, and the resulting sugar can then be used as a first-generation biofuel.	As an example of how resource recycling can be beneficial, many items thrown away contain metals that can be recycled to create a profit, such as the components in circuit boards. Wood chippings in pallets and other packaging materials can be recycled to useful products for horticulture. The recycled chips can cover paths, walkways, or arena surfaces.	3	False	non-plagiarism	plant produc crop specif grown use fuel offer high biomass output per hectar low input grain use liquid transport fuel straw burn produc heat electr plant biomass also degrad cellulos glucos seri chemic treatment result sugar use first-gener biofuel	exampl resourc recycl benefici mani item thrown away contain metal recycl creat profit compon circuit board wood chip pallet packag materi recycl use product horticultur recycl chip cover path walkway arena surfac

history	At the height of the Roman Empire, “Egyptianising” architectural elements became very popular. Sites such as the Villa Adriana in Tivoli, built in the second century CE as a retreat for Emperor Hadrian, is positively lousy with Egyptianised statues and architectural elements – including an Egyptian-style shrine dedicated to the emperor’s lover, Antinous.	With this, the journey of the Flaminian Obelisk from an ancient Egyptian tribute to the sun god to a Renaissance curio was completed. But the monument’s impact on history continued – in 1921, a year before seizing power after the March on Rome, Benito Mussolini (1883-1945) led a march past the obelisk during the Third Fascist Congress. Later on, the Flaminian Obelisk and the many other Egyptian and Roman obelisks found throughout the city prompted the dictator to create his own: a massive 300-ton marble behemoth which still stands in Foro Italico (then Foro Mussolini) bearing the Latin inscription MVSSOLINI DVX(Mussolini, the Leader).	2	False	non-plagiarism	height roman empir egyptianis architectur element becam popular site villa adriana tivoli built second centuri ce retreat emperor posit lousi egyptianis statu architectur element includ egyptian-styl shrine dedic emperor lover antin	journey flaminian obelisk ancient egyptian tribut sun god renaiss curio complet monument impact histori continu 1921 year seiz power march rome benito mussolini 1883-1945 led march past obelisk third fascist congress later flaminian obelisk mani egyptian roman obelisk found throughout citi prompt dictat creat massiv 300-ton marbl behemoth still stand foro italico foro mussolini bear latin inscript mvssolini dvx mussolini leader

economy	"""One caveat to this narrative is that, since white-only suffrage excluded black and colored Africans from voting, the """"median voter"""" of Apartheid South Africa was by no means synonymous with the """"median citizen."""" In fact, the """"median voter,"""" who was most likely white and affluent, and the """"median citizen,"""" who was most likely black and poor, had different experiences in sanctioned South Africa. As in other historical examples of sanctioning, the population that the sanction was supposed to help suffered the brunt of the economic devastation; """"the median citizen""""– the many Africans under Apartheid – experienced even more drastic economic collapse under the sanction regime than did white voters.39 For instance, in companies formerly operated by MNCs before disinvestment, internal corporate regulations that barred discriminatory practices were repealed once each MNC administration was replaced by domestic management. The change in administration exposed the African employees of these companies to even greater discrimination and economic damage.40 Given the severe, short-term economic devastation experienced by Africans, which dwarfed the inconveniences suffered by white voters, if the Africans did have electoral power, there would probably have been an even greater political pressure to end apartheid. If the """"median voter"""" did include Africans, Apartheid may have collapsed even sooner under sanctions; but again, there would be no Apartheid if Africans had the vote."""

environment	Renewable energy technologies are getting cheaper, through technological change and through the benefits of mass production and market competition. A 2018 report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), found that the cost of renewable energy is quickly falling, and will likely be equal to or less than the cost of non-renewables such as fossil fuels by 2020.

environment	The water cycle, is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. Water can change states among liquid, vapour, and ice at various places in the water cycle. Although the balance of water on Earth remains fairly constant over time, individual water molecules can come and go.	However, emissions per unit distance travelled is not necessarily the best indicator for the carbon footprint of air travel, because the distances covered are commonly longer than by other modes of travel. It is the total emissions for a trip that matters for a carbon footprint, not merely the rate of emissions.

geography	Augustin de Candolle contributed to the field of biogeography as he observed species competition and the several differences that influenced the discovery of the diversity of life. He was a Swiss botanist and created the first Laws of Botanical Nomenclature in his work, Prodromus. He discussed plant distribution and his theories eventually had a great impact on Charles Darwin, who was inspired to consider species adaptations and evolution after learning about botanical geography. De Candolle was the first to describe the differences between the small-scale and large-scale distribution patterns of organisms around the globe.	In the United States the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 set forth requirements for analysis of federal government actions (such as highway construction projects and land management decisions) in terms of specific environmental criteria. Numerous state laws have echoed these mandates, applying the principles to local-scale actions. The upshot has been an explosion of documentation and study of environmental consequences before the fact of development actions.	4	False	non-plagiarism	augustin de candol contribut field biogeographi observ speci competit sever differ influenc discoveri divers life swiss botanist creat first law botan nomenclatur work prodromu discuss plant distribut theori eventu great impact charl darwin inspir consid speci adapt evolut learn botan geographi de candol first describ differ small-scal large-scal distribut pattern organ around globe	unit state nation environment polici act nepa 1969 set forth requir analysi feder govern action highway construct project land manag decis term specif environment criteria numer state law echo mandat appli principl local-scal action upshot explos document environment consequ fact develop action

This was embodied most clearly in the communique released after the ASEAN Summit in 2015, whereby ASEAN affirmed its commitment to eliminating trade tariffs, of which nearly 96% have been eliminated.21 Incrementally, every country has been reducing restrictions on competition in protected sectors such as banking, which is a major source of revenue for economies. The commitment to protectionism can be seen in agreements signed within the AEC, including the ASEAN Comprehensive Investment Agreement (ACIA). The ACIA institutionalizes each country's commitment to liberalize their business sectors and this has """"eased restrictions to cross-border trade.""""22 This is supplemented by the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement, a """"legal framework to realize the free flow of goods within the AEC.""""

environment	Air pollution, in the form of aerosols, not only puts a large burden on human health, but also affects the climate on a large scale. From 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface was observed, a phenomenon popularly known as global dimming, typically attributed to aerosols from biofuel and fossil fuel burning. Aerosol removal by precipitation gives tropospheric aerosols an atmospheric lifetime of only about a week, while stratospheric aerosols can remain in the atmosphere for a few years. Globally, aerosols have been declining since 1990, meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much.	Thermosphere: The top of the thermosphere is the bottom of the exosphere, called the exobase. Its height varies with solar activity and ranges from about 350–800 km (220–500 mi; 1,150,000–2,620,000 ft). The International Space Station orbits in this layer, between 320 and 380 km (200 and 240 mi).	4	False	non-plagiarism	air pollut form aerosol put larg burden human health also affect larg scale 1961 1990 gradual reduct amount sunlight reach earth surfac observ phenomenon popularli known global dim typic attribut aerosol biofuel fossil fuel burn aerosol remov precipit give tropospher aerosol atmospher lifetim week stratospher aerosol remain atmospher year global aerosol declin sinc 1990 mean longer mask greenhous ga warm much	thermospher top thermospher bottom exospher call exobas height vari solar activ rang 350800 km 220500 mi 1 150 0002 620 000 ft intern space station orbit layer 320 380 km 200 240 mi

Atwater, the son of a Methodist minister, was motivated by the opposite concern: at a time when malnutrition was widespread, he sought to help poor people find the most cost-effective items to fill themselves up.	And though the jury is still out on whether it improves symptoms, exercise may help prevent or delay dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease. For example, one 2017 review in The Journals of Gerontology: Biological Sciences found that activity was associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer’s down the line. The link was strongest for people who purposely exercised in their spare time, rather than those who had physically active jobs. This suggests mental benefits may depend on your chosen activity, in addition to the time you put into it.	2	False	non-plagiarism	today mani us want monitor calori consumpt order lose maintain weight atwat son methodist minist motiv opposit concern time malnutrit widespread sought help poor peopl find cost-effect item fill	though juri still whether improv symptom exercis may help prevent delay dementia includ alzheim diseas exampl one 2017 review journal gerontolog biolog scienc found activ associ lower risk alzheim line link strongest peopl purpos exercis spare time rather physic activ job suggest mental benefit may depend chosen activ addit time put

It came to prominence and became wealthy through olive oil production in Spain.	The process used by the Egyptians was surprisingly straightforward. Initially, they levelled off the ground above a vein of granite. Then the rough shape of the obelisk was marked using hard stone pounders.

health	Getting off the drugs is exceedingly difficult, according to Whitaker, because when they are withdrawn the compensatory mechanisms are left unopposed. When Celexa is withdrawn, serotonin levels fall precipitously because the presynaptic neurons are not releasing normal amounts and the postsynaptic neurons no longer have enough receptors for it. Similarly, when an antipsychotic is withdrawn, dopamine levels may skyrocket. The symptoms produced by withdrawing psychoactive drugs are often confused with relapses of the original disorder, which can lead psychiatrists to resume drug treatment, perhaps at higher doses.	“It can be anything from running to biking to rowing,” says Dr. Bohnsack	4	False	non-plagiarism	get drug exceedingli difficult accord whitak withdrawn compensatori mechan left unoppos celexa withdrawn serotonin level fall precipit presynapt neuron releas normal amount postsynapt neuron longer enough receptor similarli antipsychot withdrawn dopamin level may skyrocket symptom produc withdraw psychoact drug often confus relaps origin disord lead psychiatrist resum drug treatment perhap higher dose	anyth run bike row dr bohnsack

economy	If the MNC perceives the sanction to be a short-term affair, losses from hiccup in trade is far outweighed by the benefits of a sustained, long-term trade relationship.	From the above results, we can see the most significant reduction in income inequality comes from an increase in GDP per capita, with the Economic Complexity Index coming in at a close second. This is consistent with previous research that has found a robust correlation between ECI and GDP per capita. An important consideration is that ECI is also shown to predict future economic growth, so improvements in productive structures have yielded both reductions in income inequality and greater levels of economic growth (Hartmann et al., 2017).	1	False	non-plagiarism	mnc perceiv sanction short-term affair loss hiccup trade far outweigh benefit sustain long-term trade relationship	result see signific reduct incom inequ come increas gdp per capita complex index come close second consist previou research found robust correl eci gdp per capita import consider eci also shown predict futur growth improv product structur yield reduct incom inequ greater level growth hartmann et al 2017

Rather than simply imitating Egyptian architecture, they brought some home with them from Egypt.	The process used by the Egyptians was surprisingly straightforward.

environment	The effects of climate change on humans, mostly due to warming and shifts in precipitation, have been detected worldwide. Regional impacts of climate change are now observable on all continents and across ocean regions, with low-latitude, less developed areas facing the greatest risk.

economy	A King Hussein Bridge Crossing able to handle shipping containers would reduce Palestinian reliance on Israeli ports.	Now that the incentive/disincentive model for MNCs has been established, let us apply it to South Africa and Rhodesia. In each case study, I will first establish that the decisions of MNCs to engage or disengage, Rhodesia for the former and South Africa for the latter, weakened the state's economic health and its capacity to reject the sanctioner demand to end apartheid. This shows that MNC decision did affect the outcome of the sanction. Second, I will trace the decision-making process of key MNCs where I find the measure of the input variables, derive the incentive/disincentive from the inputs and add the incentive/ disincentive to derive the final decision of the MNCs and its impact on the sanctioned economy.	1	False	non-plagiarism	king hussein bridg cross abl handl ship contain would reduc palestinian relianc isra port	incent disincent model mnc establish let us appli south africa rhodesia case first establish decis mnc engag disengag rhodesia former south africa latter weaken state health capac reject sanction demand end apartheid show mnc decis affect outcom sanction second trace decision-mak process key mnc find measur input variabl deriv incent disincent input add incent disincent deriv final decis mnc impact sanction economi

health	Unlike the cool Kirsch, Whitaker is outraged by what he sees as an iatrogenic (i.e., inadvertent and medically introduced) epidemic of brain dysfunction, particularly that caused by the widespread use of the newer (“atypical”) antipsychotics, such as Zyprexa, which cause serious side effects. Here is what he calls his “quick thought experiment”:	It is important that clinical trials, particularly those dealing with subjective conditions like depression, remain double-blind, with neither patients nor doctors knowing whether or not they are getting a placebo. That prevents both patients and doctors from imagining improvements that are not there, something that is more likely if they believe the agent being administered is an active drug instead of a placebo. Faced with his findings that nearly any pill with side effects was slightly more effective in treating depression than an inert placebo, Kirsch speculated that the presence of side effects in individuals receiving drugs enabled them to guess correctly that they were getting active treatment—and this was borne out by interviews with patients and doctors—which made them more likely to report improvement. He suggests that the reason antidepressants appear to work better in relieving severe depression than in less severe cases is that patients with severe symptoms are likely to be on higher doses and therefore experience more side effects.	2	False	non-plagiarism	unlik cool kirsch whitak outrag see iatrogen e inadvert medic introduc epidem brain dysfunct particularli caus widespread use newer atyp antipsychot zyprexa caus seriou side effect call quick thought experi	import clinic trial particularli deal subject condit like depress remain double-blind neither doctor know whether get placebo prevent doctor imagin improv someth like believ agent administ activ drug instead placebo face find nearli pill side effect slightli effect treat depress inert placebo kirsch specul presenc side effect individu receiv drug enabl guess correctli get activ treatmentand born interview doctorswhich made like report improv suggest reason antidepress appear work better reliev sever depress less sever case sever symptom like higher dose therefor experi side effect

However, these jobs are not lost, but are reallocated to other firms. At the industry level, the study finds no statistical link between energy prices and net job creation, indicating that jobs lost at affected firms are compensated by increases in employment in other firms operating in the same sector during the same year.	In order to decrease CO 2 emissions, the reliance of fossil fuels must be lowered. These fuels produce much CO 2 across all forms of their usage.

Kirsch is a faithful proponent of the scientific method, and his voice therefore brings a welcome objectivity to a subject often swayed by anecdotes, emotions, or, as we will see, self-interest.	The evidence he marshals for this theory varies in quality. He doesn’t sufficiently acknowledge the difficulty of studying the natural history of any illness over a fifty-some-year time span during which many circumstances have changed, in addition to drug use. It is even more difficult to compare long-term outcomes in treated versus untreated patients, since treatment may be more likely in those with more severe disease at the outset.

Researchers in this field are striving to design molecular mimics of photosynthesis that use a wider region of the solar spectrum, employ catalytic systems made from abundant, inexpensive materials that are robust, readily repaired, non-toxic, stable in a variety of environmental conditions and perform more efficiently allowing a greater proportion of photon energy to end up in the storage compounds, i.e., carbohydrates (rather than building and sustaining living cells).

The value of any cultural category whatever such as ‘land’ is indeed arbitrary in the sense that it is constituted on principled distinctions among signs which, in relation to objects, are never the only possible distinctions. Even an ecological anthropology would recognize that the extent to which a particular tract of land is a ‘productive resource,’ if it is at all, depends on the cultural order in place.

Even an ecological anthropology would recognize that the extent to which a particular tract of land is a ‘productive resource,’ if it is at all, depends on the cultural order in place. Economics might thus find a place in the general semiology that Saussure envisioned—while at the same time hedging the entrance requirement with restrictive clauses.

economy	If similar sanction packages were imposed on similar countries, why did one collapse much more quickly than the other? When neither national context nor sanction package can explain sanction outcomes, the literature turns to micro variables for answers. Consider the following metaphor: if two people with similar phenotypes drank the same amount of milk, why might only one of them suffer indigestion? The doctors would answer that despite the similarities in the general circumstances, there was a miniscule, unclear, but nevertheless very crucial difference between the two individuals, perhaps a slight genetic disposition that makes one lactose intolerant. In a similar fashion, if proponents of sanctions attempted to resolve the Rhodesia-South Africa paradox, they would have answered that despite the similarities between the two sanctions, there must have been micro but very significant differences that contributed to the divergent outcomes. Unfortunately, these micro variables are inconclusive in respect to explaining the South Africa/ Rhodesia case.

The Accord set the goal of sending $100 billion per year to developing countries in assistance for mitigation and adaptation by 2020, and proposed the founding of the Green Climate Fund. As of 2020 , the fund has failed to reach its expected target, and risks a shrinkage in its funding.	Artificial photosynthesis uses techniques including nanotechnology to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds by splitting water to produce hydrogen and then using carbon dioxide to make methanol. Researchers in this field are striving to design molecular mimics of photosynthesis that use a wider region of the solar spectrum, employ catalytic systems made from abundant, inexpensive materials that are robust, readily repaired, non-toxic, stable in a variety of environmental conditions and perform more efficiently allowing a greater proportion of photon energy to end up in the storage compounds, i.e., carbohydrates (rather than building and sustaining living cells). However, prominent research faces hurdles, Sun Catalytix a MIT spin-off stopped scaling up their prototype fuel-cell in 2012, because it offers few savings over other ways to make hydrogen from sunlight.	4	False	non-plagiarism	2009 copenhagen accord wide portray disappoint low goal reject poorer nation includ g77 associ parti aim limit increas global mean temperatur 2 0 c 3 6 f accord set goal send 100 billion per year develop countri assist mitig adapt 2020 propos found green fund 2020 fund fail reach expect target risk shrinkag fund	artifici photosynthesi use techniqu includ nanotechnolog store solar electromagnet chemic bond split water produc use dioxid make methanol research field strive design molecular mimic photosynthesi use wider region solar spectrum employ catalyt system made abund inexpens materi robust readili repair non-tox stabl varieti environment condit perform effici allow greater proport photon end storag compound e carbohydr rather build sustain live howev promin research face hurdl sun catalytix mit spin-off stop scale prototyp fuel-cel 2012 offer save way make sunlight

environment	Solar energy, radiant light and heat from the sun, is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as solar heating, photovoltaics, concentrated solar power (CSP), concentrator photovoltaics (CPV), solar architecture and artificial photosynthesis. Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture, convert, and distribute solar energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air. Active solar technologies encompass solar thermal energy, using solar collectors for heating, and solar power, converting sunlight into electricity either directly using photovoltaics (PV), or indirectly using concentrated solar power (CSP).	Better social advantages can lead to new sources of employment and potentially lifting communities out of poverty especially in some of the developing poorer countries and cities.

health	The calorie – which comes from “calor”, the Latin for “heat” – was originally used to measure the efficiency of steam engines: one calorie is the energy required to heat 1kg of water by one degree Celsius. Only in the 1860s did German scientists begin using it to calculate the energy in food. It was an American agricultural chemist, Wilbur Atwater, who popularised the idea that it could be used to measure both the energy contained in food and the energy the body expended on things like muscular work, tissue repair and powering the organs. In 1887, after a trip to Germany, he wrote a series of wildly popular articles in Century, an American magazine, suggesting that “food is to the body what fuel is to the fire.” He introduced the public to the notion of “macronutrients” – carbohydrates, protein and fat – so called because the body needs a lot of them.

environment	While locations of warming vary, the patterns are independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted, because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet. Since the pre-industrial period, global average land temperatures have increased almost twice as fast as global average surface temperatures. This is because of the larger heat capacity of oceans, and because oceans lose more heat by evaporation. Over 90% of the additional energy in the climate system over the last 50 years has been stored in the ocean, with the remainder warming the atmosphere, melting ice, and warming the continents.

environment	And yet key questions remain about the nature of the pledges and how they will be achieved. What does the “net” actually entail – what level of residual emissions, and what kind of offsets or carbon removal? How will firms go about reinventing themselves? Does this mean shifting towards renewable electricity (an entirely different business model), producing low-carbon fuels, eliminating methane emissions (currently around 15% of all energy-related GHG emissions), developing carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), or all of the above and more? Crucially, when will the necessary investment be forthcoming? As recently as 2019, 99% of firms’ capital investment was flowing into core oil and gas projects – a far cry from reinvention. Even among those firms that have net-zero plans for mid-century, most of them do not include intermediate targets. Clarity on some of these questions may come from the forthcoming Science-based Targets methodology for the oil and gas sector.

chemistry	Chances are, most — if not all — of the produce in your kitchen is threatened by fungal diseases. The threat looms large for food staples of the world such as rice, wheat, potatoes and maize (SN: 9/22/05). Pathogenic fungi are also coming for our coffee, sugarcane, bananas and other economically important crops. Annually, fungal diseases destroy a third of all harvests and pose a dire threat to global food security.	Hydrogen bonds are typically thought of as weak electrical attractions rather than true chemical bonds. Covalent bonds, on the other hand, are strong chemical bonds that hold together atoms within a molecule and result from electrons being shared among atoms. Now, researchers report that an unusually strong variety of hydrogen bond is in fact a hybrid, as it involves shared electrons, blurring the distinction between hydrogen and covalent bonds.	4	False	non-plagiarism	chanc produc kitchen threaten fungal diseas threat loom larg food stapl world rice wheat potato maiz sn 9 22 05 pathogen fungi also come coffe sugarcan banana econom import crop annual fungal diseas destroy third harvest pose dire threat global food secur	bond typic thought weak electr attract rather true chemic bond coval bond hand strong chemic bond hold togeth atom within molecul result electron share among atom research report unusu strong varieti bond fact hybrid involv share electron blur distinct coval bond

A team led by Jason White, an environmental toxicologist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven, is fortifying crops with nutrients fashioned into nanosized packages, which boost plants’ innate immunity against pathogenic fungi more efficiently than traditional plant feeding.

Second, because of disinvestment, the South African economy lost the practical and technical knowhow of the MNCs that was now integral to maintain South African competitiveness.

Andrew Gordon explains that in the case of Japanese labor disputes almost none were caused by machines crowding out low-skill labor.[16] Rather, he suggests that most disputes were driven by a desire for respect and social status.[16] Japan has always had a limited internal labor force, making individual workers more powerful in their demands for job security (i.e., a seller’s market for labor). This observation highlights another pillar in the foundation for the rise of lifelong employment, that is, that a concern for job security is paramount among Japanese workers .

Stimulus measures so far announced do include meaningful support for the green transition – in particular in the EU – but much more needs to be done. The OECD reports that while at least 30 countries among the OECD its key partners have included measures to support the transition to greener economies as part of their recovery programmes, many are also planning measures that will likely have direct or indirectly negative impacts on the environment. According to Energy Policy Tracker estimates, G20 countries have so far committed USD 234.73 billion in support to fossil fuel energy versus USD 151.29 billion for clean energy.	In 2016, the EIA reported that in the US electricity is responsible for roughly 37% of Carbon Dioxide emissions, making it a potential target for reductions.

covid19	Immunosuppression is a major risk factor for opportunistic infections [1]. Therefore, since the very beginning of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, kidney transplant recipients have been considered a fragile population at higher risk of infection and poor outcomes [2, 3]. Finding that the most common risk factors for mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), such as older age, diabetes, and hypertension, are also common in transplanted individuals further supported this notion.	Key Messages: The development of reliable diagnostic assays is crucial not only for a correct diagnosis and containment of COVID-19 pandemic, but also for the decision-making process that is behind the clinical decisions, eventually contributing to the improvement of patient management. Furthermore, with the advent of vaccine and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, serological assays will be instrumental for the validation of these new therapeutic options.	3	False	non-plagiarism	immunosuppress major risk factor opportunist infect 1 therefor sinc begin sever acut respiratori syndrom coronaviru 2 sars-cov-2 pandem kidney transplant recipi consid fragil popul higher risk poor outcom 2 3 find common risk factor mortal coronaviru diseas 2019 covid-19 older age diabet hypertens also common transplant individu support notion	key messag develop reliabl diagnost assay crucial correct diagnosi contain covid-19 pandem also decision-mak process behind clinic decis eventu contribut improv patient manag furthermor advent vaccin therapeut monoclon antibodi sars-cov-2 serolog assay instrument valid therapeut option

While locations of warming vary, the patterns are independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted, because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet. Since the pre-industrial period, global average land temperatures have increased almost twice as fast as global average surface temperatures. This is because of the larger heat capacity of oceans, and because oceans lose more heat by evaporation. Over 90% of the additional energy in the climate system over the last 50 years has been stored in the ocean, with the remainder warming the atmosphere, melting ice, and warming the continents.	1	False	non-plagiarism	requir 100 one reduct spacex target ten one reduct reaction engin may make 100 one reduct possibl	locat warm vari pattern independ greenhous gase emit gase persist long enough diffus across planet sinc pre-industri period global averag land temperatur increas almost twice fast global averag surfac temperatur larger heat capac ocean ocean lose heat evapor 90 addit system last 50 year store ocean remaind warm atmospher melt ice warm contin

economy	Now that the incentive/disincentive model for MNCs has been established, let us apply it to South Africa and Rhodesia. In each case study, I will first establish that the decisions of MNCs to engage or disengage, Rhodesia for the former and South Africa for the latter, weakened the state's economic health and its capacity to reject the sanctioner demand to end apartheid. This shows that MNC decision did affect the outcome of the sanction. Second, I will trace the decision-making process of key MNCs where I find the measure of the input variables, derive the incentive/disincentive from the inputs and add the incentive/ disincentive to derive the final decision of the MNCs and its impact on the sanctioned economy.	4 (December 2002): 892-93.	4	False	non-plagiarism	incent disincent model mnc establish let us appli south africa rhodesia case first establish decis mnc engag disengag rhodesia former south africa latter weaken state health capac reject sanction demand end apartheid show mnc decis affect outcom sanction second trace decision-mak process key mnc find measur input variabl deriv incent disincent input add incent disincent deriv final decis mnc impact sanction economi	4 decemb 2002 892-93

chemistry	Now, a new idea is taking root: Help plants stand their ground by giving them the tools to fight their own battles. A team led by Jason White, an environmental toxicologist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven, is fortifying crops with nutrients fashioned into nanosized packages, which boost plants’ innate immunity against pathogenic fungi more efficiently than traditional plant feeding. Over the past few years, the researchers have devised various nanonutrient concoctions that boost the fungal resistance of soybeans, tomatoes, watermelons and, recently, eggplants, as reported in the April Plant Disease.	Polyethylene is a long molecule, in which hydrogen atoms are connected to a carbon backbone that can be thousands of carbon atoms long. The platinum is good at breaking carbon-hydrogen bonds, Scott says. “When you do that, you generate hydrogen in the reactor, and the platinum catalyst can use the hydrogen to break the carbon-carbon bonds [in the molecule backbone]. So it actually chops the chain into smaller pieces.”	3	False	non-plagiarism	idea take root help plant stand ground give tool fight battl team led jason white environment toxicologist connecticut agricultur experi station fortifi crop nutrient fashion nanos packag boost plant innat immun pathogen fungi effici tradit plant feed past year research devis variou nanonutri concoct boost fungal resist soybean tomato watermelon recent eggplant report april plant diseas	polyethylen long molecul atom connect backbon thousand atom long platinum good break carbon-hydrogen bond scott gener reactor platinum catalyst use break carbon-carbon bond molecul backbon actual chop chain smaller piec

What better signal that a green recovery is good for growth and jobs than for some of the world’s most profitable companies to voluntarily pledge their own transformation? Governments can take heed by continuing to reorient energy stimulus towards clean energy, while actively supporting the needed transition in skills and workforce.	However, emissions per unit distance travelled is not necessarily the best indicator for the carbon footprint of air travel, because the distances covered are commonly longer than by other modes of travel. It is the total emissions for a trip that matters for a carbon footprint, not merely the rate of emissions.

covid19	Outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in the United States and in European countries in February 2020. Urgent action was called for, since experts estimated that 30 to 70% of people in these Western countries could become infected — a frightening projection at a time when the Covid-19 mortality rate was estimated to be substantially higher than we now know it to be. In March 2020, Michael Ryan, executive director of the Health Emergencies Program of the World Health Organization (WHO), implored countries to act, noting that when it comes to epidemic response, “speed trumps perfection” but “the greatest error is not to move.” At the time, the only tools for containing Covid-19 were social distancing, testing, case isolation, and contact tracing.	Suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections are confirmed after detection of unique and specific target regions within the viral genome. According to the PCR design, the specific target regions may include ORF1ab, RdRp, N, and S genes. In addition, some commercial assays include also the amplification of the common beta coronavirus E gene, which is amplified along with one or more specific target genes.

chemistry	Scott, the UC Santa Barbara chemist, proposes partially breaking down these sturdy plastics in a more controlled way, under milder conditions, to make other kinds of useful molecules. She and colleagues recently came up with a way to transform polyethylene into alkylaromatic compounds, which can be used as biodegradable ingredients in shampoos, detergents and other products. The process involves placing polyethylene inside a reaction chamber set to 280° C, with a catalyst powder containing platinum nanoparticles.	What’s more, the new electrolyte doesn’t degrade the battery’s electrodes, which helps the battery last longer. In lab experiments, Sun and colleagues were able to drain and recharge a new zinc-air battery cell 320 times over 160 hours.	3	False	non-plagiarism	scott uc santa barbara chemist propos partial break sturdi control way milder condit make kind use molecul colleagu recent came way transform polyethylen alkylaromat compound use biodegrad ingredi shampoo deterg product process involv place polyethylen insid reaction chamber set 280 c catalyst powder contain platinum nanoparticl	electrolyt doesnt degrad batteri electrod help batteri last longer lab experi sun colleagu abl drain recharg zinc-air batteri cell 320 time 160 hour

Deforestation can also contribute to changing temperatures by affecting the release of aerosols and other chemical compounds that influence clouds, and by changing wind patterns	There is an overwhelming scientific consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused mainly by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases, with 90–100% (depending on the exact question, timing and sampling methodology) of publishing climate scientists agreeing. The consensus has grown to 100% among research scientists on anthropogenic global warming as of 2019. No scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view.

environment	The theory of peak oil was published in 1956. In the 1970s environmentalists promoted the development of renewable energy both as a replacement for the eventual depletion of oil, as well as for an escape from dependence on oil, and the first electricity-generating wind turbines appeared. Solar had long been used for heating and cooling, but solar panels were too costly to build solar farms until 1980.	Earth's geothermal energy originates from the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of minerals (in currently uncertain but possibly roughly equal proportions). The geothermal gradient, which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface	3	False	non-plagiarism	theori peak oil publish 1956 1970 environmentalist promot develop renew replac eventu deplet oil well escap depend oil first electricity-gener wind turbin appear solar long use heat cool solar panel costli build solar farm 1980	earth geotherm origin origin format planet radioact decay miner current uncertain possibl roughli equal proport geotherm gradient differ temperatur core planet surfac drive continu conduct thermal form heat core surfac

chemistry	“The enzyme is like a molecular scissor,” says Alain Marty, chief scientific officer at Carbios. But because it evolved to decompose plant matter, not plastic, it’s not perfect. To make the enzyme better at snipping apart PET, “we redesigned what we call the active site of the enzyme,” Marty says. This involved swapping out some of the amino acids along that PET docking site for others.	Because each plastic has to be recycled separately, those films are not recyclable.

The only relapse of anxiety he suffers nowadays happens when he hears Tori Amos singing “Bliss” – the song playing when he was kidnapped – which he says “is a real pity because it’s a great song”.	That is why the idea that highly pathogenic animal viruses such as H5N1 bird flu cycling among chickens, for example, can suddenly mutate into a lethal, transmissible human virus makes little evolutionary sense.

economy	Disinvestment harmed South African industries in two ways. First, it cut off local production facilities, previously owned by MNC subsidiaries, from the MNC's global supply and distribution network, leading to drastic reduction in corporate profits, wage, and unemployment. Second, because of disinvestment, the South African economy lost the practical and technical knowhow of the MNCs that was now integral to maintain South African competitiveness. The MNC decision to disinvest reduced South African access to global supply/distribution chains and MNC knowhow, which in turn paralyzed productivity growth from 1985 to 1993.34 This stagnation was caused by the sanction, as the economy recovered its high productivity growth after the sanction was lifted.	115-116).

geography	Buffon's law eventually became a principle of biogeography by explaining how similar environments were habitats for comparable types of organisms. Buffon also studied fossils which led him to believe that the earth was over tens of thousands of years old, and that humans had not lived there long in comparison to the age of the earth.	This work also suggests ecosystem rates of change will continue to accelerate over the coming decades, as modern climate change further adds to this long history of flux. And by showing that recent biodiversity trends are the start of a longer-term acceleration in ecosystem transformations, the new study provides context for other recent reports that global biodiversity changes have accelerated over the last century.	2	False	non-plagiarism	buffon law eventu becam principl biogeographi explain similar environ habitat compar type organ buffon also studi fossil led believ earth ten thousand year old human live long comparison age earth	work also suggest ecosystem rate chang continu acceler come decad modern chang add long histori flux show recent biodivers trend start longer-term acceler ecosystem transform provid context recent report global biodivers chang acceler last centuri

There is indeed an inscription (CIL XIII 1685) that mentions a donation from Hadrian to the altar of the Three Gauls, but the gaps in the text do not allow us to specify the nature of this favour (Fellague, 2016). Unfortunately, no trace of the monument itself has been found.	For it has been granted to each Successor who will lead the School of Epicurus in Athens, both to make dispositions about the entire administration concerning the School by means of Greek testament, and to choose at will, either a Greek or Roman Head of the School. Because this excellent extension of authority has been granted to us – which binds us to express true gratitude to him who is verily a benefactor and guardian of all culture and therefore a most venerable emperor; to me personally also most dear in all respects as both an outstanding master and a good son – it is proper that each of those who have been trusted with the decision concerning the headship always tries to appoint in his own place the best of those who share in the doctrine and to attach more importance to the view of the community as a whole than to his own predilections for particular individuals	3	False	non-plagiarism	altar appear rebuilt adapt cover templ origin column support statu victori replac column egyptian syenit fishwick 1972 inde inscript cil xiii 1685 mention donat altar three gaul gap text allow us specifi natur favour fellagu 2016 unfortun trace monument found	grant successor lead school epicuru athen make disposit entir administr concern school mean greek testament choos either greek roman head school excel extens author grant us bind us express true gratitud verili benefactor guardian cultur therefor vener emperor person also dear respect outstand master good son proper trust decis concern headship alway tri appoint place best share doctrin attach import view commun whole predilect particular individu

For three years, she has been working with an interdisciplinary team in collaboration with the University of Basel’s Digital Humanities Lab to examine the papyrus collection, which in the meantime has been digitalized, transcribed, annotated and translated. The project team has already presented the history of the papyrus collection through an exhibition in the University Library last year. They plan to publish all their findings at the start of 2019.	The facts of this recent event, which went largely unnoticed by a distracted world, are quickly laid out: In early July of this year, Turkey’s Council of State debated annulment of the 1934 decision to convert Hagia Sophia to a museum. The outcome of this debate was a forgone conclusion, as the Council was packed with loyalists to President Erdogan, the Islamist head of state, who had also served as Prime Minister from 2004-2014. On July 14, the Council voted to proceed and it was announced that the first Islamic prayers would be held inside the building on July 24.

One risk, they suggest, comes when hungry people in Africa and elsewhere forge deep into forests and jungles to hunt ‘bushmeat’ – rodents, rabbits, monkeys, apes – with exposure to dangerous pathogens the unhappy result. Those pathogens move silently among wild animals, but can also explode with terrifying ferocity among people when humans venture where they shouldn’t. According to the same line of thought, another proposed risk would result when birds spread a new pandemic strain to chickens in factory farms and, ultimately, to us.

Low levels of economic complexity are accompanied by high levels of income inequality because the structure of the economy is less inclusive and economic power more concentrated. Thus, redistributive policies to achieve lower income inequality have hard limits and must be accompanied by efforts to diversify the economy (Hartmann et al., 2016)	2	False	non-plagiarism	1980 ten year later number household drop 85 243 suggest trend reduc entrepreneuri activ popul typic stimul suffici number worker seek incom opportun addit instead favor stabl employ larg corpor	low level complex accompani high level incom inequ structur economi less inclus power concentr thu redistribut polici achiev lower incom inequ hard limit must accompani effort diversifi economi hartmann et al 2016

One can suggest that this decrease indicates a healthier economic climate which helps new businesses survive; however, since its onset occurred in 1985 when the economy of big enterprises started to collapse, the “positive” trend most likely is another indicator of a dramatic slowdown in entrepreneurial activity in Japan, simply because small businesses are much more susceptible to bankruptcy	(2016).

environment	There are different variants of climate denial: some deny that warming takes place at all, some acknowledge warming but attribute it to natural influences, and some minimise the negative impacts of climate change. Manufacturing uncertainty about the science later developed into a manufacturing controversy: creating the belief that there is significant uncertainty about climate change within the scientific community in order to delay policy changes. Strategies to promote these ideas include criticism of scientific institutions, and questioning the motives of individual scientists. An echo chamber of climate-denying blogs and media has further fomented misunderstanding of climate change.	Temperature rise on land is about twice the global average increase, leading to desert expansion and more common heat waves and wildfires.

So, when a mosquito lands on a dusting of starburst-shaped crystals, it should be easier for deltamethrin molecules to be absorbed into the insect’s body via its feet.	Plus, recycling breaks some of the chemical bonds in plastic molecules, affecting the strength and consistency of the material. Melting down and remolding plastic is sort of like reheating pizza in the microwave — you get out basically what you put in, just not as good.

geography	Climate research is made difficult by the large scale, long time periods, and complex processes which govern climate. Climate is governed by physical laws which can be expressed as differential equations. These equations are coupled and nonlinear, so that approximate solutions are obtained by using numerical methods to create global climate models. Climate is sometimes modeled as a stochastic process but this is generally accepted as an approximation to processes that are otherwise too complicated to analyze.	Landscape architecture is the design of outdoor areas, landmarks, and structures to achieve environmental, social-behavioural, or aesthetic outcomes. It involves the systematic design and general engineering of various structures for construction and human use, investigation of existing social, ecological, and soil conditions and processes in the landscape, and the design of other interventions that will produce desired outcomes. The scope of the profession is broad and can be subdivided into several sub-categories including professional or licensed landscape architects who are regulated by governmental agencies and possess the expertise to design a wide range of structures and landforms for human use; landscape design which is not a licensed profession; site planning; stormwater management; erosion control; environmental restoration; parks, recreation and urban planning; visual resource management; green infrastructure planning and provision; and private estate and residence landscape master planning and design; all at varying scales of design, planning and management. A practitioner in the profession of landscape architecture may be called a landscape architect, however in jurisdictions where professional licenses are required it is often only those who possess a landscape architect license who can be called a landscape architect.	4	False	non-plagiarism	research made difficult larg scale long time period complex process govern govern physic law express differenti equat equat coupl nonlinear approxim solut obtain use numer method creat global model sometim model stochast process gener accept approxim process otherwis complic analyz	architectur design outdoor area landmark structur achiev environment social-behaviour aesthet outcom involv systemat design gener engin variou structur construct human use investig exist social ecolog soil condit process design intervent produc desir outcom scope profess broad subdivid sever sub-categori includ profession licens architect regul government agenc possess expertis design wide rang structur landform human use design licens profess site plan stormwat manag eros control environment restor park recreat urban plan visual resourc manag green infrastructur plan provis privat estat resid master plan design vari scale design plan manag practition profess architectur may call architect howev jurisdict profession licens requir often possess architect licens call architect

covid19	Some health care workers were lost to follow-up after terminating employment at our hospitals; this was likely to have occurred at similar rates in seropositive and seronegative staff. Not all PCR-positive results from government symptomatic testing sites were communicated to the hospital. This is a study of predominantly healthy adult health care workers 65 years of age or younger; further studies are needed to assess postinfection immunity in other populations, including children, older adults, and persons with coexisting conditions, including immunosuppression.	The same serum samples were also analyzed for the presence of specific anti–SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. We observed a difference in levels of neutralizing antibodies between samples from the previously infected participants (geometric mean titer, 569; 95% CI, 467 to 670) and those from the previously uninfected participants (geometric mean titer, 118; 95% CI, 85 to 152) (P<0.001) (median levels are shown in Figure 1B). No substantial differences were noted between the titers from the previously infected and the previously uninfected participants according to age (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org) or sex (data not shown).	3	False	non-plagiarism	health care worker lost follow-up termin employ hospit like occur similar rate seroposit seroneg staff pcr-posit result govern symptomat test site commun hospit predominantli healthi adult health care worker 65 year age younger studi need assess postinfect immun popul includ children older adult person coexist condit includ immunosuppress	serum sampl also analyz presenc specif antisars-cov-2 neutral antibodi observ differ level neutral antibodi sampl previous infect particip geometr mean titer 569 95 ci 467 670 previous uninfect particip geometr mean titer 118 95 ci 85 152 p 0 001 median level shown figur 1b substanti differ note titer previous infect previous uninfect particip accord age fig s1 supplementari appendix avail full text letter nejm org sex data shown

covid19	Real-time PCR assays represent the gold standard for the laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, false-negative results may occur. Several factors may be responsible for these incorrect results: quality of the specimen, viral load below the limit of detection (LOD) of the method, incorrect handling of the specimen, problems during shipment, timing of sampling (sample collected too early or too late during infection), and source of sample (upper or lower respiratory tract). In the initial phase of COVID-19 disease, upper respiratory tract sample can result in RT-PCR negative, while chest computed tomography images show the presence of pulmonary abnormalities consistent with viral pneumonia [9-11]. Repeat testing can increase the chance of detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA [12].	Similarly, in transplanted patients, the regular follow-up monitoring is conditioned by the persistence of the infection.

The “Chilica-pod” is then plugged into a smartphone, where an app analyzes the data. Adapted from ACS Applied Nano Materials 2020	That newfound understanding of chemical bonding also raises questions about what qualifies as a molecule. Atoms connected by covalent bonds are considered part of a single molecule, while those connected by hydrogen bonds can remain separate entities. So bonds in limbo between the two raise the question, “when do you go from two molecules to one molecule?” Tokmakoff says.	3	False	non-plagiarism	portabl chili-shap gadget determin chili pepper spice level measur capsaicin fieri molecul help give pepper kick chilica-pod plug smartphon app analyz data adapt ac appli nano materi 2020	newfound understand chemic bond also rais question qualifi molecul atom connect coval bond consid part singl molecul connect bond remain separ entiti bond limbo two rais question go two molecul one molecul tokmakoff

geography	Landscape planners are concerned with landscape planning for the location, scenic, ecological and recreational aspects of urban, rural, and coastal land use. Their work is embodied in written statements of policy and strategy, and their remit includes master planning for new developments, landscape evaluations and assessments, and preparing countryside management or policy plans. Some may also apply an additional specialism such as landscape archaeology or law to the process of landscape planning.

covid19	The overall mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Italy was 11.6%; a worse outcome is reported in patients with chronic diseases and cardiovascular comorbidity [28]. Consistent with previous reports [24, 25], our population showed an elevated death rate (22.2% in patients with decompensated renal failure, 38.0% in dialysis patients, and 31.2% in transplant recipients), confirming the fragility of chronic nephropathic patients, in spite of the timely therapy against COVID-19 given in most of the cases and the reduction of immunosuppression in transplanted patients. Sadly, the work suffers from the heterogeneity of therapeutic intervention for COVID-19, mainly related to the period in which the study was conducted, the early stages of the pandemic outbreak in Italy, when a reference treatment scheme was not well defined yet.	Considering that transplant recipients were advised to shield in the UK months earlier than the general population and their generally more cautious attitude to limit exposure to infections, the authors of the study predicted a much lower exposure rate. However, the fact that family members may not always be as careful as the transplant recipients makes this conclusion hard to substantiate.	3	False	non-plagiarism	overal mortal sars-cov-2 itali 11 6 wors outcom report chronic diseas cardiovascular comorbid 28 consist previou report 24 25 popul show elev death rate 22 2 decompens renal failur 38 0 dialysi 31 2 transplant recipi confirm fragil chronic nephropath spite time therapi covid-19 given case reduct immunosuppress transplant sadli work suffer heterogen therapeut intervent covid-19 mainli relat period conduct earli stage pandem outbreak itali refer treatment scheme well defin yet	consid transplant recipi advis shield uk month earlier gener popul gener cautiou attitud limit exposur infect author predict much lower exposur rate howev fact famili member may alway care transplant recipi make conclus hard substanti

If the Utilitarian Theory of Value fails to obtain when considered in tandem with the socio-cultural nexuses that operate on the individual, we are left to develop an alternative theory of value; one that does not universalize, but instead focuses on the contextual elements that hold influence over people.

The Arpanet was not, in itself, intended as some kind of secret weapon to put the Soviets in their place: it was simply a way to enable researchers to access computers remotely, because computers were still vast and expensive, and the scientists needed a way to share resources	Despite all these predictions, though, the arrival of the internet in the shape we know it today was never a matter of inevitability. It was a crucial idiosyncracy of the Arpanet that its funding came from the American defence establishment – but that the millions ended up on university campuses, with researchers who embraced an anti-establishment ethic, and who in many cases were committedly leftwing; one computer scientist took great pleasure in wearing an anti-Vietnam badge to a briefing at the Pentagon.

covid19	Importantly, an immunocompromised state has been shown to accelerate in-host SARS-CoV-2 viral evolution and formation of new viral variants [5, 19]. Potential factors contributing to the observed within-host evolution is prolonged infection and the compromised immune status of the host, possibly resulting in a different set of selective pressures compared with an immune-competent host. This could be particularly important based on recent data suggesting that a more sustained antibody response and greater CD4+ T-cell activation with increased somatic mutations on B cells are associated with shorter disease trajectories [20]. Mutations that alter RNA virus may affect SARS-CoV-2 virulence and transmissibility and facilitate global spread, similar to what happened with D614G mutation [21].

history	In the early year of AD 121, Pompeia Plotina, the greatly respected widow of the emperor Trajan, sent Hadrian a letter asking him to help the Epicurean school in Athens solve an issue regarding the rights of succession. According to Roman law, the head of the school was obliged to appoint a new leader from among Roman citizens only with a will written in Latin. This restriction made the number of candidates too limited and prevented the best members of the school from being appointed.	It was a well-kept secret among historians during the late 19th and early 20th centuries that the practice of magic was widespread in the ancient Mediterranean. Historians wanted to keep the activity low-key because it did not support their idealised view of the Greeks and Romans. Today, however, magic is a legitimate area of scholarly enquiry, providing insights into ancient belief systems as well as cultural and social practices.	3	False	non-plagiarism	earli year ad 121 pompeia plotina greatli respect widow emperor trajan sent letter ask help epicurean school athen solv issu regard right success accord roman law head school oblig appoint leader among roman citizen written latin restrict made number candid limit prevent best member school appoint	well-kept secret among historian late 19th earli 20th centuri practic magic widespread ancient mediterranean historian want keep activ low-key support idealis view greek roman today howev magic legitim area scholarli enquiri provid insight ancient belief system well cultur social practic

covid19	The anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies measured in the UK study were targeted against the RBD viral antigen [10]. There is evidence that anti-RBD antibodies may provide information on functional immunity, given reported correlations between RBD antibodies and neutralizing antibodies [17, 18]. However, ad hoc functional studies testing the viral-neutralizing capacity of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies produced by transplant recipients are needed. Understanding the antiviral response in kidney transplant recipients is key not just to interpret data of antibody screening studies but more importantly to manage immunosuppression during COVID-19 and for future vaccine strategies.	Initial series of hospitalized kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 showed alarming rates of mortality, between 25 and 35% [4]. These rates are higher than in-hospital case-fatality rates reported in the general population (ranging between 10 and 20%) [5-7]. However, there are also series showing that solid organ recipients have similar COVID-19-related mortality rates than the general population [8]. This suggests that such increased risk might be mitigated, for instance, by early hospitalization and a greater ease of access to intensive care unit [8].	4	False	non-plagiarism	anti-sars-cov-2 antibodi measur uk target rbd viral antigen 10 evid anti-rbd antibodi may provid inform function immun given report correl rbd antibodi neutral antibodi 17 18 howev ad hoc function studi test viral-neutr capac anti-sars-cov-2 antibodi produc transplant recipi need understand antivir respons kidney transplant recipi key interpret data antibodi screen studi importantli manag immunosuppress covid-19 futur vaccin strategi	initi seri hospit kidney transplant recipi covid-19 show alarm rate mortal 25 35 4 rate higher in-hospit case-fat rate report gener popul rang 10 20 5-7 howev also seri show solid organ recipi similar covid-19-rel mortal rate gener popul 8 suggest increas risk might mitig instanc earli hospit greater eas access intens care unit 8

If agricultural nanotechnology is to achieve widespread use, it needs to observe environmental and safety regulations, as well as — perhaps even more challengingly — overcome consumer wariness. So far, White and his collaborators found no residual nanonutrients in their produce that would end up on the dining table of consumers.

health	It is important that clinical trials, particularly those dealing with subjective conditions like depression, remain double-blind, with neither patients nor doctors knowing whether or not they are getting a placebo. That prevents both patients and doctors from imagining improvements that are not there, something that is more likely if they believe the agent being administered is an active drug instead of a placebo. Faced with his findings that nearly any pill with side effects was slightly more effective in treating depression than an inert placebo, Kirsch speculated that the presence of side effects in individuals receiving drugs enabled them to guess correctly that they were getting active treatment—and this was borne out by interviews with patients and doctors—which made them more likely to report improvement. He suggests that the reason antidepressants appear to work better in relieving severe depression than in less severe cases is that patients with severe symptoms are likely to be on higher doses and therefore experience more side effects.	The only major organisation to shift the emphasis beyond calories is one dedicated to helping its customers slim down: Weight Watchers. In 2001 the world’s best-known dieting firm introduced a points system that moved away from focusing exclusively on calories to also classifying foods according to their sugar and saturated fat content, and their impact on appetite. Chris Stirk, the firm’s general manager in Britain, says the organisation made the change because relying on calories to lose weight is “outdated”: “Science evolves daily, monthly, yearly, let alone since the 1800s.”	4	False	non-plagiarism	import clinic trial particularli deal subject condit like depress remain double-blind neither doctor know whether get placebo prevent doctor imagin improv someth like believ agent administ activ drug instead placebo face find nearli pill side effect slightli effect treat depress inert placebo kirsch specul presenc side effect individu receiv drug enabl guess correctli get activ treatmentand born interview doctorswhich made like report improv suggest reason antidepress appear work better reliev sever depress less sever case sever symptom like higher dose therefor experi side effect	major organis shift emphasi beyond calori one dedic help custom slim weight watcher 2001 world best-known diet firm introduc point system move away focus exclus calori also classifi food accord sugar satur fat content impact appetit chri stirk firm gener manag britain organis made chang reli calori lose weight outdat scienc evolv daili monthli yearli let alon sinc 1800

If solar variations were responsible for the observed warming, warming of both the troposphere and the stratosphere would be expected, but that has not been the case.	3	False	non-plagiarism	2013 alta wind center california 1 5 gw world largest singl wind farm walney extens london 0 7 gw largest offshor wind farm world gansu wind farm china 7 9 gw largest wind project gener project consist 18 wind farm	evid greenhous gase caus recent chang come measur show warm lower atmospher tropospher coupl cool upper atmospher stratospher solar variat respons observ warm warm tropospher stratospher would expect case
history	Shortly after celebrating Rome’s birthday (see here), Hadrian departed on his journey to the northern provinces and began his first extensive voyage through the empire. As he intended to be absent for a considerable time with little idea of the date in return, it was necessary to leave the control of Rome in trustworthy hands. He left Annius Verus, the grandfather of Marcus Aurelius, who was just born (see here), and his friend Turbo to look after the people and the senate.	As a Hellenophile, Hadrian was familiar with the work of the philosophers Epictetus, the famous stoic, and a certain Heliodorus, an Epicurean, both of whom he considered intimate friends (HA Had. 16.10)	3	False	non-plagiarism	shortli celebr rome birthday see depart journey northern provinc began first extens voyag empir intend absent consider time littl idea date return necessari leav control rome trustworthi hand left anniu veru grandfath marcu aureliu born see friend turbo look peopl senat	hellenophil familiar work philosoph epictetu famou stoic certain heliodoru epicurean consid intim friend ha 16 10

covid19	Considering that transplant recipients were advised to shield in the UK months earlier than the general population and their generally more cautious attitude to limit exposure to infections, the authors of the study predicted a much lower exposure rate. However, the fact that family members may not always be as careful as the transplant recipients makes this conclusion hard to substantiate.	The anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies measured in the UK study were targeted against the RBD viral antigen [10]. There is evidence that anti-RBD antibodies may provide information on functional immunity, given reported correlations between RBD antibodies and neutralizing antibodies [17, 18]. However, ad hoc functional studies testing the viral-neutralizing capacity of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies produced by transplant recipients are needed. Understanding the antiviral response in kidney transplant recipients is key not just to interpret data of antibody screening studies but more importantly to manage immunosuppression during COVID-19 and for future vaccine strategies.	2	False	non-plagiarism	consid transplant recipi advis shield uk month earlier gener popul gener cautiou attitud limit exposur infect author predict much lower exposur rate howev fact famili member may alway care transplant recipi make conclus hard substanti	anti-sars-cov-2 antibodi measur uk target rbd viral antigen 10 evid anti-rbd antibodi may provid inform function immun given report correl rbd antibodi neutral antibodi 17 18 howev ad hoc function studi test viral-neutr capac anti-sars-cov-2 antibodi produc transplant recipi need understand antivir respons kidney transplant recipi key interpret data antibodi screen studi importantli manag immunosuppress covid-19 futur vaccin strategi

chemistry	Even if every piece of plastic trash could easily be recycled, that still wouldn’t solve the world’s plastic problem. There are a couple major issues with how recycling currently works that severely limit the usability of recycled materials.	After 24 hours in the reaction chamber, “most of the products are liquids, and most of the liquids are alkylaromatics,” Scott says. In experiments, about 69 percent of the plastic in a low-density polyethylene bag was converted into liquid. About 55 percent of a high-density polyethylene bottle cap was transformed. The process produces hydrocarbon gases too, which could be used to generate heat to run the reaction at a recycling plant, Scott says.	2	False	non-plagiarism	even everi piec trash could easili recycl still wouldnt solv world problem coupl major issu recycl current work sever limit usabl recycl materi	24 hour reaction chamber product liquid liquid alkylaromat scott experi 69 percent low-dens polyethylen bag convert liquid 55 percent high-dens polyethylen bottl cap transform process produc hydrocarbon gase could use gener heat run reaction recycl plant scott

covid19	Challenges remain, however. Integration of digital contact-tracing technologies with existing test-and-trace systems appears to be an important determinant of their utility.5 More importantly, digital contact-tracing technologies must be made accessible, particularly to people with limited access to smartphone technology, those with limited digital health literacy, speakers of languages other than a country’s primary language, and migrant communities. Increasing accessibility is important not only for maximizing uptake, but also for ensuring that all members of society can benefit equitably from digital advances in contact tracing. If these challenges can be overcome, Western countries will have gained a trustworthy, privacy-preserving, accessible tool to use during the next pandemic to enhance contact-tracing capacity and control disease spread until elimination is achieved.

health	With long-term use of psychoactive drugs, the result is, in the words of Steve Hyman, a former director of the NIMH and until recently provost of Harvard University, “substantial and long-lasting alterations in neural function.” As quoted by Whitaker, the brain, Hyman wrote, begins to function in a manner “qualitatively as well as quantitatively different from the normal state.” After several weeks on psychoactive drugs, the brain’s compensatory efforts begin to fail, and side effects emerge that reflect the mechanism of action of the drugs. For example, the SSRIs may cause episodes of mania, because of the excess of serotonin	Getting off the drugs is exceedingly difficult, according to Whitaker, because when they are withdrawn the compensatory mechanisms are left unopposed. When Celexa is withdrawn, serotonin levels fall precipitously because the presynaptic neurons are not releasing normal amounts and the postsynaptic neurons no longer have enough receptors for it. Similarly, when an antipsychotic is withdrawn, dopamine levels may skyrocket. The symptoms produced by withdrawing psychoactive drugs are often confused with relapses of the original disorder, which can lead psychiatrists to resume drug treatment, perhaps at higher doses.	2	False	non-plagiarism	long-term use psychoact drug result word steve hyman former director nimh recent provost harvard univers substanti long-last alter neural function quot whitak brain hyman wrote begin function manner qualit well quantit differ normal state sever week psychoact drug brain compensatori effort begin fail side effect emerg reflect mechan action drug exampl ssri may caus episod mania excess serotonin	get drug exceedingli difficult accord whitak withdrawn compensatori mechan left unoppos celexa withdrawn serotonin level fall precipit presynapt neuron releas normal amount postsynapt neuron longer enough receptor similarli antipsychot withdrawn dopamin level may skyrocket symptom produc withdraw psychoact drug often confus relaps origin disord lead psychiatrist resum drug treatment perhap higher dose

environment	We know decarbonisation will require a massive shift of investment away from fossil fuel and into such areas as renewable energy, energy efficiency in buildings and industry, electric vehicles and public transport. A key challenge for policy makers is to understand how to make best use of available policy levers to help accelerate this shift towards low-carbon investment. This includes facilitating the financing of low-carbon investment, including financing through equity investment or – on the debt side – through bank loans and bonds.

Geographic information systems are powerful databases that collect all types of information (maps, reports, statistics, satellite images, surveys, demographic data, and more) and link each piece of data to a geographic reference point, such as geographic coordinates. This data, called geospatial information, can be stored, analyzed, modeled, and manipulated in ways not possible before GIS computer technology existed.	Computerized systems that allow for precise calculations of how things are distributed and relate to one another have made the study of geographic information systems (GIS) an increasingly important specialty within geography	3	True	partial literal	computer system allow precis calcul thing distribut relat one anoth made geograph inform system gi increasingli import specialti within geographi geograph inform system power databas collect type inform map report statist satellit imag survey demograph data link piec data geograph refer point geograph coordin data call geospati inform store analyz model manipul way possibl gi comput technolog exist	computer system allow precis calcul thing distribut relat one anoth made geograph inform system gi increasingli import specialti within geographi
environment	People seldom find absolutely natural environments on Earth, and naturalness usually varies in a continuum, from 100% natural in one extreme to 0% natural in the other. More precisely, we can consider the different aspects or components of an environment, and see that their degree of naturalness is not uniform. If, for instance, in an agricultural field, the mineralogic composition and the structure of its soil are similar to those of an undisturbed forest soil, but the structure is quite different.	Heat conducts from the core to the surrounding rock. Extremely high temperature and pressure cause some rock to melt, which is commonly known as magma	3	False	non-plagiarism	peopl seldom find absolut natur environ earth natur usual vari continuum 100 natur one extrem 0 natur precis consid differ aspect compon environ see degre natur uniform instanc agricultur field mineralog composit structur soil similar undisturb forest soil structur quit differ	heat conduct core surround rock extrem high temperatur pressur caus rock melt commonli known magma

geography	The patterns of species distribution across geographical areas can usually be explained through a combination of historical factors such as: speciation, extinction, continental drift, and glaciation. Through observing the geographic distribution of species, we can see associated variations in sea level, river routes, habitat, and river capture. Additionally, this science considers the geographic constraints of landmass areas and isolation, as well as the available ecosystem energy supplies.	Otherwise, the field of biogeography would be seen as a purely descriptive one.	3	False	non-plagiarism	pattern speci distribut across geograph area usual explain combin histor factor speciat extinct continent drift glaciat observ geograph distribut speci see associ variat sea level river rout habitat river captur addit scienc consid geograph constraint landmass area isol well avail ecosystem suppli	otherwis field biogeographi would seen pure descript one

Moreover, since these transition costs are typically highly localised in regions specialised in polluting activities, they can also translate into potentially significant regional effects and thus political costs.

environment	The changing vegetation occurs because when trees cannot get adequate water they start to deteriorate, leading to a decreased food supply for the wildlife in an area.	In contrast to the natural environment is the built environment. In such areas where humans have fundamentally transformed landscapes such as urban settings and agricultural land conversion, the natural environment is greatly changed into a simplified human environment. Even acts which seem less extreme, such as building a mud hut or a photovoltaic system in the desert, the modified environment becomes an artificial one. Though many animals build things to provide a better environment for themselves, they are not human, hence beaver dams, and the works of mound-building termites, are thought of as natural.	1	False	non-plagiarism	chang veget occur tree cannot get adequ water start deterior lead decreas food suppli wildlif area	contrast natur environ built environ area human fundament transform landscap urban set agricultur land convers natur environ greatli chang simplifi human environ even act seem less extrem build mud hut photovolta system desert modifi environ becom artifici one though mani anim build thing provid better environ human henc beaver dam work mound-build termit thought natur

The main reinforcing feedbacks are the water-vapour feedback, the ice–albedo feedback, and probably the net effect of clouds.

environment	A carbon footprint is the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by an individual, event, organization, service, place or product, expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent. Greenhouse gases, including the carbon-containing gases carbon dioxide and methane, can be emitted through the burning of fossil fuels, land clearance and the production and consumption of food, manufactured goods, materials, wood, roads, buildings, transportation and other services. The term was popularized by a $250 million advertising campaign by the oil and gas company BP in an attempt to move public attention away from restricting the activities of fossil fuel companies and onto individual responsibility for solving climate change.	Growth in consumption of coal and oil could end by 2020 due to increased uptake of renewables and natural gas.

geography	Landscape architecture continues to develop as a design discipline and to respond to the various movements in architecture and design throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. Thomas Church was a mid-century landscape architect significant in the profession. Roberto Burle Marx in Brazil combined the International style and native Brazilian plants and culture for a new aesthetic. Innovation continues today solving challenging problems with contemporary design solutions for master planning, landscapes, and gardens.	Climate research is made difficult by the large scale, long time periods, and complex processes which govern climate. Climate is governed by physical laws which can be expressed as differential equations. These equations are coupled and nonlinear, so that approximate solutions are obtained by using numerical methods to create global climate models. Climate is sometimes modeled as a stochastic process but this is generally accepted as an approximation to processes that are otherwise too complicated to analyze.	4	False	non-plagiarism	architectur continu develop design disciplin respond variou movement architectur design throughout 20th 21st centuri thoma church mid-centuri architect signific profess roberto burl marx brazil combin intern style nativ brazilian plant cultur aesthet innov continu today solv challeng problem contemporari design solut master plan landscap garden	research made difficult larg scale long time period complex process govern govern physic law express differenti equat equat coupl nonlinear approxim solut obtain use numer method creat global model sometim model stochast process gener accept approxim process otherwis complic analyz

environment	Further evidence for greenhouse gases being the cause of recent climate change come from measurements showing the warming of the lower atmosphere (the troposphere), coupled with the cooling of the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere). If solar variations were responsible for the observed warming, warming of both the troposphere and the stratosphere would be expected, but that has not been the case.	Solar energy, radiant light and heat from the sun, is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as solar heating, photovoltaics, concentrated solar power (CSP), concentrator photovoltaics (CPV), solar architecture and artificial photosynthesis. Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture, convert, and distribute solar energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air. Active solar technologies encompass solar thermal energy, using solar collectors for heating, and solar power, converting sunlight into electricity either directly using photovoltaics (PV), or indirectly using concentrated solar power (CSP).	2	False	non-plagiarism	evid greenhous gase caus recent chang come measur show warm lower atmospher tropospher coupl cool upper atmospher stratospher solar variat respons observ warm warm tropospher stratospher would expect case	solar radiant light heat sun har use rang ever-evolv technolog solar heat photovolta concentr solar power csp concentr photovolta cpv solar architectur artifici photosynthesi solar technolog broadli character either passiv solar activ solar depend way captur convert distribut solar passiv solar techniqu includ orient build sun select materi favor thermal mass light dispers properti design space natur circul air activ solar technolog encompass solar thermal use solar collector heat solar power convert sunlight electr either directli use photovolta pv indirectli use concentr solar power csp

Real-time PCR assays represent the gold standard for the laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, false-negative results may occur. Several factors may be responsible for these incorrect results: quality of the specimen, viral load below the limit of detection (LOD) of the method, incorrect handling of the specimen, problems during shipment, timing of sampling (sample collected too early or too late during infection), and source of sample (upper or lower respiratory tract). In the initial phase of COVID-19 disease, upper respiratory tract sample can result in RT-PCR negative, while chest computed tomography images show the presence of pulmonary abnormalities consistent with viral pneumonia [9-11].

history	Still magic remains, in part, a mystery when it comes to erotic practice and conventions. The two same-sex spells from the Greek Magical Papyri, for example, attest to the reality of erotic desire among ancient women, but do not shed light on whether this type of sexuality was condoned in Roman Egypt. Perhaps such desires were not socially approved; hence the recourse to magic. Perhaps the desires of Sarapammon for Ptolemais were also outside the bounds of acceptability, which led him to the surreptitious and desperate world of magic.	Shortly after their decision to convert Hagia Sophia from a museum to a mosque, the Turkish authorities issued a vague statement outlining a bizarre plan to cover the mosaics and other Byzantine representational images inside the building with laser light or draperies during Muslim prayers.
