covid19	With the introduction of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, it will be important to monitor the development of neutralizing antibodies against the virus and their duration. At the time of writing, the vaccine Comirnaty developed by Pfizer-BioNTech against SARS-CoV-2 has received both the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicine Agency approval (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine|FDA; European Medicine Agency recommends first COVID-19 vaccine for authorization in the EU|European Medicines Agency [europa.eu]), and the approval for the AIFA (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco), and is being distributed in Italy. This vaccine demonstrated a 95% efficacy in clinical trial in people 16 years of age or older [33].	The overall message emerging from our data indicates a delayed viral clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and can be interpreted in view of the cellular and humoral immunodepression typical of this population [7, 30, 31]. Comparably to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has been proven to induce a T-lymphocyte-mediated immune response, but this protective mechanism might be suppressed in patients with lymphopenia, including those under chronic hemodialysis and renal transplant recipients [32, 33].	3	False	non-plagiarism	introduct vaccin sars-cov-2 import monitor develop neutral antibodi viru durat time write vaccin comirnati develop pfizer-biontech sars-cov-2 receiv food drug administr european medicin agenc approv pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccin fda european medicin agenc recommend first covid-19 vaccin author eu european medicin agenc europa eu approv aifa agenzia italiana del farmaco distribut itali vaccin demonstr 95 efficaci clinic trial peopl 16 year age older 33	overal messag emerg data indic delay viral clearanc sars-cov-2 interpret view cellular humor immunodepress typic popul 7 30 31 compar coronavirus sars-cov-2 proven induc t-lymphocyte-medi immun respons protect mechan might suppress lymphopenia includ chronic hemodialysi renal transplant recipi 32 33

What do the commitments mean for achieving the Paris Agreement goals, and can they help to convince governments to be bolder and to really deliver on their plans for a “green recovery” after COVID-19?

The first test of the new compatibilizer involved welding together strips of polyethylene and polypropylene. Ordinarily, the two materials easily peel apart. But with a layer of compatibilizer between them, the plastic strips broke, rather than the compatibilizer seal, when pulled apart.	“Our understanding of chemical bonding, the way we teach it, is very much black and white,” says chemist Andrei Tokmakoff of the University of Chicago.

economy	Linking Economic Complexity, Institutions, and Income Inequality. World Development, 93(September), 75–93	MacArthur started labor reform from the distribution of property in the land redistribution act. The reform’s purpose was to redistribute land from landlords who did not individually use the land to the low-class workers who rented the land and actually used it.[23] Although many believe this event acted as a de-industrializer of the labor force, it is important to understand the reform did not affect a majority of working Japanese. The land reform only helped solidify the path of corporate labor because by 1965, mining, construction and manufacturing accounted for 41% of the labor force, while agriculture only employed 26% of the population.[10] The land reform acted both as and industrial and political policy.[24] Although the policy had little effect on agricultural output, it dramatically increased the amount of conservative thinking in the urban population.[24]	2	False	non-plagiarism	link complex institut incom inequ world develop 93 septemb 7593	macarthur start labor reform distribut properti land redistribut act reform purpos redistribut land landlord individu use land low-class worker rent land actual use 23 although mani believ event act de-industri labor forc import understand reform affect major work japanes land reform help solidifi path corpor labor 1965 mine construct manufactur account 41 labor forc agricultur employ 26 popul 10 land reform act industri polit polici 24 although polici littl effect agricultur output dramat increas amount conserv think urban popul 24

economy	As mentioned, the Atlas of Economic Complexity uses UN export data to compute the ECI; this reliance on export data means it may be a less accurate measurement for the productive capabilities of larger economies, such as the US, which are service-based on not substantial exporters (Natarajan, 2013). Theoretically, the ECI formulas could be modified to use data on the composition of both goods and services, but the lack of a comprehensive data set and uniform categorization of services make this difficult if not impossible. Despite these issues, the ECI remains relevant when considering developing countries where exports are a substantial part of the domestic economy. With regards to Indonesia and Venezuela exports represented over 25% of both countries’ GDP, on average, for the time period under consideration (World Bank, 2016).

Ironically, while he is credited with reerecting no less than four ancient obelisks in Rome, he had very little appreciation for the city’s own antiquity, ordering several ancient monuments demolished and the stone reused as building material.	The decisive evidence came from Italy – an expert saw parallels to the famous Ravenna papyri from the chancery of the Archdiocese of Ravenna.

Streams play an important corridor role in connecting fragmented habitats and thus in conserving biodiversity. The study of streams and waterways in general is known as surface hydrology.	To put these pledges in context, the challenge of heading off dangerous climate change is still immense. Because of COVID-19, global emissions are expected to drop steeply in 2020. But to stand a good chance of keeping the increase in global temperature to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, emissions will need to continue to decline at nearly the same rate – around 8% – every year from now until 2030.

It studies the periodicity of weather events over years to millennia, as well as changes in long-term average weather patterns, in relation to atmospheric conditions. Climatologists study both the nature of climates – local, regional or global – and the natural or human-induced factors that cause climates to change. Climatology considers the past and can help predict future climate change.	Yet each sediment core only provides information about one place on Earth, so true global-scale analyses of past vegetation change require the amassing and curating of many such records.

covid19	Across all the study groups, most infections were asymptomatic, and the incidence of both asymptomatic and symptomatic infections decreased. Nursing homes that were located in counties with the highest incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection had the most incident cases but still had large decreases (Table S2). We observed inconsistent patterns in the incidence of infection among residents relative to rates of vaccination among staff members (Table S3).	In the UK study, risk factors for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies included a nonwhite background, a diagnosis of diabetes, and a history of allograft rejection. The association between ethnicity and diabetes with COVID-19 infection is consistent with risk factors for COVID-19 found in studies within the general population [12, 13] and with prior studies identifying common risk factors for posttransplant infections [14].	3	False	non-plagiarism	across group infect asymptomat incid asymptomat symptomat infect decreas nurs home locat counti highest incid sars-cov-2 incid case still larg decreas tabl s2 observ inconsist pattern incid among resid rel rate vaccin among staff member tabl s3	uk risk factor develop anti-sars-cov-2 antibodi includ nonwhit background diagnosi diabet histori allograft reject associ ethnic diabet covid-19 consist risk factor covid-19 found studi within gener popul 12 13 prior studi identifi common risk factor posttranspl infect 14

geography	Modern climate change is driven by the human emissions of greenhouse gas from the burning of fossil fuel driving up global mean surface temperatures. Rising temperatures are only one aspect of modern climate change though, with includes observed changes in precipitation, storm tracks and cloudiness. Warmer temperatures are driving further changes in the climate system, such as the widespread melt of glaciers, sea level rise and shifts in flora and fauna.	Hydrology is the study of Earth’s water: its properties, distribution, and effects. Hydrologists are especially concerned with the movement of water as it cycles from the ocean to the atmosphere, then back to Earth’s surface. Hydrologists study the water cycle through rainfall into streams, lakes, the soil, and underground aquifers. Hydrologists provide insights that are critical to building or removing dams, designing irrigation systems, monitoring water quality, tracking drought conditions, and predicting flood risk.	3	False	non-plagiarism	modern chang driven human emiss greenhous ga burn fossil fuel drive global mean surfac temperatur rise temperatur one aspect modern chang though includ observ chang precipit storm track cloudi warmer temperatur drive chang system widespread melt glacier sea level rise shift flora fauna	hydrolog earth water properti distribut effect hydrologist especi concern movement water cycl ocean atmospher back earth surfac hydrologist water cycl rainfal stream lake soil underground aquif hydrologist provid insight critic build remov dam design irrig system monitor water qualiti track drought condit predict flood risk

environment	Biomass, biogas and biofuels are burned to produce heat/power and in doing so harm the environment. Pollutants such as sulphurous oxides (SO x ), nitrous oxides (NO x ), and particulate matter (PM) are produced from the combustion of biomass; the World Health Organisation estimates that 7 million premature deaths are caused each year by air pollution. Biomass combustion is a major contributor.	Before the Industrial Revolution, naturally-occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be about 33 °C (59 °F) warmer than it would have been in their absence.

chemistry	“It’s a very promising technology,” says Schwab, but she adds that there are other aspects to consider before its implementation. If agricultural nanotechnology is to achieve widespread use, it needs to observe environmental and safety regulations, as well as — perhaps even more challengingly — overcome consumer wariness. So far, White and his collaborators found no residual nanonutrients in their produce that would end up on the dining table of consumers. But other implications, such as the nanomaterials’ persistence in the environment and hazards posed to human handlers, have yet to be fully understood.	Chemical bonds between deltamethrin molecules in the starburst-shaped crystals are not as strong as those in the original microcrystal structure. “The molecules are intrinsically less happy, or settled, in the arrangement,” Kahr says. So, when a mosquito lands on a dusting of starburst-shaped crystals, it should be easier for deltamethrin molecules to be absorbed into the insect’s body via its feet.	4	False	non-plagiarism	promis technolog schwab add aspect consid implement agricultur nanotechnolog achiev widespread use need observ environment safeti regul well perhap even challengingli overcom consum wari far white collabor found residu nanonutri produc would end dine tabl consum implic nanomateri persist environ hazard pose human handler yet fulli understood	chemic bond deltamethrin molecul starburst-shap crystal strong origin microcryst structur molecul intrins less happi settl arrang kahr mosquito land dust starburst-shap crystal easier deltamethrin molecul absorb insect bodi via feet

environment	The voluntary market in North America is divided between members of the Chicago Climate Exchange and the Over The Counter (OTC) market. The Chicago Climate Exchange is a voluntary yet legally binding cap-and-trade emission scheme whereby members commit to the capped emission reductions and must purchase allowances from other members or offset excess emissions. The OTC market does not involve a legally binding scheme and a wide array of buyers from the public and private spheres, as well as special events that want to go carbon neutral. Being carbon neutral refers to achieving net zero carbon emissions by balancing a measured amount of carbon released with an equivalent amount sequestered or offset, or buying enough carbon credits to make up the difference.	As we look to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, land use will play an integral part in addressing many of the key socio-economic challenges ahead, including avoiding possible emergence of new zoonotic diseases.

health	When it was found that psychoactive drugs affect neurotransmitter levels in the brain, as evidenced mainly by the levels of their breakdown products in the spinal fluid, the theory arose that the cause of mental illness is an abnormality in the brain’s concentration of these chemicals that is specifically countered by the appropriate drug. For example, because Thorazine was found to lower dopamine levels in the brain, it was postulated that psychoses like schizophrenia are caused by too much dopamine. Or later, because certain antidepressants increase levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain, it was postulated that depression is caused by too little serotonin. (These antidepressants, like Prozac or Celexa, are called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) because they prevent the reabsorption of serotonin by the neurons that release it, so that more remains in the synapses to activate other neurons.) Thus, instead of developing a drug to treat an abnormality, an abnormality was postulated to fit a drug.

But for those less familiar with Byzantium and its achievements, here is a very short list of websites, documentaries and books I believe to be of some value (all links open in a new tab):	With the Ottoman Turkish conquest of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, which by then comprised little more than the City of Constantinople itself, the great church was looted of its remaining valuables, its portable artworks hacked to bits and its clergy killed or sold into slavery, with the building itself converted to a mosque. It remained so until the secular Turkish government of Kemal Attaturk converted it to a museum.	2	False	non-plagiarism	would requir great mani post blog attempt meaning summari byzantin art histori task best undertaken less familiar byzantium achiev short list websit documentari book believ valu link open tab	ottoman turkish conquest byzantin empir 1453 compris littl citi constantinopl great church loot remain valuabl portabl artwork hack bit clergi kill sold slaveri build convert mosqu remain secular turkish govern kemal attaturk convert museum

covid19	Serological assays have been developed using as target the highly antigenic structural proteins spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) of SARS-CoV-2. In most individuals, measurable antibodies develop within days or weeks from symptoms onset [18, 19], thus limiting the use of serological testing in the early phase of infection [20, 21]. However, serological assays are important for contact tracing, for identifying suspected cases who are PCR negative but show radiological findings suggestive of CO­VID-19 [9, 10], to identify asymptomatic carriers [22] or to determine the development of neutralizing antibodies in response to vaccination [23, 24]. Instead, doubts arise about the use of antibody tests for seroprevalence surveys for public health management reasons because the duration of circulating antibody is currently unknown [25].	serologic assays have been developed using as object the highly matter morphological proteins spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) of SARS-CoV-2 In almost individuals of import antibodies educate within years OR weeks from symptoms attack [18 19] thence limiting the use of medical science examination in the archeozoic phase angle of infection [20 21] However serologic assays ar important for striking tracing for identifying suspected cases who ar PCR unsupportive merely show imaging findings suggestive of CO­VID-19 [ 9 10] to identify symptomless carriers [22] OR to watch the growing of neutralizing antibodies in reply to vaccination [23 24] Instead doubts rebel active the use of antibody tests for seroprevalence surveys for public health direction reasons because the continuance of circulating antibody is presently unknown [25] 	4	True	structural change	serolog assay develop use target highli antigen structur protein spike nucleocapsid n sars-cov-2 individu measur antibodi develop within day week symptom onset 18 thu limit use serolog test earli phase 20 21 howev serolog assay import contact trace identifi suspect case pcr neg show radiolog find suggest covid-19 9 10 identifi asymptomat carrier 22 determin develop neutral antibodi respons vaccin 23 24 instead doubt aris use antibodi test seropreval survey public health manag reason durat circul antibodi current unknown 25	serolog assay develop use object highli matter morpholog protein spike nucleocapsid n sars-cov-2 almost individu import antibodi educ within year week symptom attack 18 thenc limit use medic scienc examin archeozo phase angl 20 21 howev serolog assay ar import strike trace identifi suspect case ar pcr unsupport mere show imag find suggest covid-19 9 10 identifi symptomless carrier 22 watch grow neutral antibodi repli vaccin 23 24 instead doubt rebel activ use antibodi test seropreval survey public health direct reason continu circul antibodi present unknown 25

environment	In September 2019 the French Parliament adopted a law on energy and climate which enshrines into French law the objective of carbon neutrality by 2050, in line with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. Carbon neutrality means reducing carbon emissions and balancing residual emissions by capture and storage. Achieving carbon neutrality in France by 2050 will require a drastic decrease in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 75%, as compared to 1990 levels.	The voluntary market in North America is divided between members of the Chicago Climate Exchange and the Over The Counter (OTC) market. The Chicago Climate Exchange is a voluntary yet legally binding cap-and-trade emission scheme whereby members commit to the capped emission reductions and must purchase allowances from other members or offset excess emissions. The OTC market does not involve a legally binding scheme and a wide array of buyers from the public and private spheres, as well as special events that want to go carbon neutral.

biology	As it turns out, those persistent topological objects can be used to categorize clusters of differing types of cells. After training their algorithm on computer-simulated cells programmed to behave like different types of cells, the team turned it loose on real experimental images of migratory cells.

The study showed that the topological algorithm was able to correctly classify different spatial patterns according to which biochemical treatment the cells had received.

geography	El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean responsible for most of the global variability in temperature, and has a cycle between two and seven years. The North Atlantic oscillation is a mode of variability that is mainly contained to the lower atmosphere, the troposphere. The layer of atmosphere above, the stratosphere is also capable of creating its own variability, most importantly in the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO), which has a cycle of approximately 30-60 days. The Interdecadal Pacific oscillation can create changes in the Pacific Ocean and lower atmosphere on decadal time scales.	Hydrology is the study of Earth’s water: its properties, distribution, and effects. Hydrologists are especially concerned with the movement of water as it cycles from the ocean to the atmosphere, then back to Earth’s surface. Hydrologists study the water cycle through rainfall into streams, lakes, the soil, and underground aquifers. Hydrologists provide insights that are critical to building or removing dams, designing irrigation systems, monitoring water quality, tracking drought conditions, and predicting flood risk.	4	False	non-plagiarism	el niosouthern oscil enso coupl ocean-atmospher phenomenon pacif ocean respons global variabl temperatur cycl two seven year north atlant oscil mode variabl mainli contain lower atmospher tropospher layer atmospher stratospher also capabl creat variabl importantli maddenjulian oscil mjo cycl approxim 30-60 day interdecad pacif oscil creat chang pacif ocean lower atmospher decad time scale	hydrolog earth water properti distribut effect hydrologist especi concern movement water cycl ocean atmospher back earth surfac hydrologist water cycl rainfal stream lake soil underground aquif hydrologist provid insight critic build remov dam design irrig system monitor water qualiti track drought condit predict flood risk

chemistry	Chemistry students the world over are familiar with covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds. Now a study has revealed a strange variety of bond that acts like a hybrid of the two. Its properties raise questions about how chemical bonds are defined, chemists report in the Jan. 8 Science.	The concept “tackles the challenge at the origin rather than trying to put a Band-Aid on the [problem],” says Leanne Gilbertson, an environmental engineer at the University of Pittsburgh who was not involved in the research. White’s strategy provides plants with the nutrients they need to trigger enzyme production to guard against pathogenic attack. Without any synthetic chemicals introduced, the strategy sidesteps any opportunity for malignant fungi to develop resistances, she says.	4	False	non-plagiarism	chemistri student world familiar coval bond bond reveal strang varieti bond act like hybrid two properti rais question chemic bond defin chemist report jan 8 scienc	concept tackl challeng origin rather tri put band-aid problem leann gilbertson environment engin univers pittsburgh involv research white strategi provid plant nutrient need trigger enzym product guard pathogen attack without synthet chemic introduc strategi sidestep opportun malign fungi develop resist
